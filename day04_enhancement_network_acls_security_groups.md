## Network ACLs vs Security Groups Fundamentals

### Understanding Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Network ACLs provide network-level access control operating at Layer 3/4, forming a critical component of perimeter defense for AI/ML environments.

**Network ACL Characteristics:**
- **Stateless Operation**: Each packet evaluated independently without connection state
- **Layer 3/4 Filtering**: Filtering based on IP addresses, protocols, and port numbers

- **Rule Ordering**: Rules processed in numerical order, first match wins
- **Bidirectional Rules**: Separate rules required for inbound and outbound traffic

**Network ACL Components:**
- **Rule Numbers**: Numerical priority determining rule evaluation order
- **Protocol**: IP protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, or protocol number)
- **Port Ranges**: Source and destination port ranges for filtering
- **IP Address Ranges**: Source and destination IP address ranges (CIDR blocks)
- **Action**: Allow or deny action for matching traffic

**AI/ML Network ACL Use Cases:**
