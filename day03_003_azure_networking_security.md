## Azure Virtual Network Fundamentals

### Virtual Network (VNet) Overview
Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for private networks in Azure. VNet enables Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. Each VNet is isolated from other virtual networks in Azure, providing a secure environment for your resources.

### Key VNet Components
**Address Space:**
- VNets are defined by one or more address spaces using CIDR notation
- Address spaces can be expanded after VNet creation
- Support for both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
- Private address ranges as defined in RFC 1918
- Non-overlapping address spaces for peered VNets

**Subnets:**
- Logical divisions within a VNet address space
- Each subnet must be associated with a route table and NSG
- Subnet size can be modified after creation (with limitations)
- Azure reserves five IP addresses in each subnet (first four and last)
- Special purpose subnets: GatewaySubnet, AzureFirewallSubnet, AzureBastionSubnet

**Resource Groups and Regions:**
- VNets exist within a single Azure region
- Can span multiple Availability Zones within a region
- Must be associated with a resource group
- Resources in different regions require VNet peering or VPN connectivity

### Default vs Custom VNet Configuration
**Default Networking Behavior:**
- Azure creates default networking when resources are deployed
- Default configurations may not meet security requirements
- Automatic public IP assignment in many cases
- Limited network segmentation and access control

**Custom VNet Benefits:**
- Complete control over network topology and security
- Proper network segmentation and micro-segmentation
- Custom IP addressing schemes
- Integration with hybrid cloud architectures
- Advanced security features and monitoring

### Azure Networking Service Hierarchy
**Subscription Level:**

- Azure Front Door for global load balancing and security

**Resource Group Level:**
- Virtual Networks and their associated subnets
- Network Security Groups and Application Security Groups
- Route tables and User Defined Routes (UDRs)
- Load balancers and application gateways

**Resource Level:**
- Network Interface Cards (NICs) attached to VMs
- Public IP addresses and their associations
- Network security rules applied to specific resources

## Network Security Groups (NSGs)

### NSG Fundamentals
Network Security Groups (NSGs) contain security rules that allow or deny inbound and outbound network traffic to Azure resources. NSGs provide basic firewall functionality and are essential for implementing network security in Azure.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stateful**: Return traffic is automatically allowed for established connections
- **Rule-Based**: Uses priority-based rules for traffic filtering
- **Bidirectional**: Separate inbound and outbound rule sets
- **Multi-Association**: Can be associated with subnets and/or network interfaces
- **Regional**: NSGs are regional resources but can be used across availability zones

### NSG Rule Structure
**Rule Components:**
- **Priority**: Numeric value (100-4096) determining rule evaluation order
- **Name**: Descriptive name for the rule
- **Port**: Single port, port range, or wildcard (*)
- **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, ESP, AH, or Any
- **Source/Destination**: IP address, CIDR block, service tag, or ASG
- **Action**: Allow or Deny

**Default Rules:**
- **AllowVNetInBound**: Allows traffic within the VNet
- **AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound**: Allows Azure Load Balancer health probes
- **DenyAllInBound**: Denies all other inbound traffic
- **AllowVNetOutBound**: Allows outbound traffic within VNet
- **AllowInternetOutBound**: Allows outbound traffic to internet
- **DenyAllOutBound**: Denies all other outbound traffic

### NSG Association Patterns
**Subnet-Level Association:**
- NSG applied to entire subnet affects all resources in the subnet
- Provides coarse-grained security control
- Suitable for subnet-wide security policies
- Easier management for large deployments

**Network Interface Association:**
- NSG applied directly to VM network interfaces
- Provides fine-grained security control
- Allows per-VM security customization
- More complex management but greater flexibility

**Layered Security Approach:**
- Both subnet and NIC-level NSGs can be applied simultaneously
- Subnet NSG processed first for inbound traffic
- NIC NSG processed second for inbound traffic
- Provides defense-in-depth security model

### Service Tags and Address Prefixes
**Service Tags:**
- Predefined groups of IP address prefixes for Azure services
- Automatically updated by Microsoft as service IP ranges change
- Examples: Internet, VirtualNetwork, AzureLoadBalancer, Storage, Sql
- Region-specific service tags available for some services

**Common Service Tags:**
- **Internet**: All internet-routable IP addresses
- **VirtualNetwork**: All VNet address space and connected on-premises spaces
- **AzureLoadBalancer**: Azure infrastructure load balancer
- **Storage**: IP address space for Azure Storage service
- **Sql**: IP address space for Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance

**Custom Service Tags:**
- User-defined groups of IP address prefixes
- Simplify rule management for common address groups
- Support for IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges
- Can be used across multiple NSGs within a subscription

### NSG Flow Logs
**Flow Log Capabilities:**

**Key Benefits:**
- **Application-Centric Security**: Rules based on application tiers rather than IP addresses
- **Dynamic Membership**: VMs can be added/removed from ASGs without rule changes
- **Simplified Management**: Easier to understand and maintain security rules
- **Scalability**: Support for large-scale deployments with many VMs

### ASG Architecture Patterns
**Three-Tier Application Model:**
- **Web Tier ASG**: Front-end web servers and load balancers
- **Application Tier ASG**: Application servers and business logic components
- **Database Tier ASG**: Database servers and data storage systems
- **Management Tier ASG**: Administrative and monitoring systems

**Microservices Architecture:**
- **Service-Specific ASGs**: Each microservice in its own ASG
- **Cross-Service Communication**: Rules allowing specific service interactions
- **API Gateway ASG**: Centralized API management and security
- **Shared Services ASG**: Common services like logging and monitoring

**Hybrid and Multi-Cloud:**
- **Cloud-Native ASGs**: Resources deployed entirely in Azure
- **Hybrid ASGs**: Combination of Azure and on-premises resources
- **Multi-Cloud ASGs**: Integration with other cloud providers
- **Edge Computing ASGs**: Edge devices and IoT endpoints

### ASG Rule Configuration
**Rule Creation Process:**
1. Create Application Security Groups for different application components
2. Assign virtual machine network interfaces to appropriate ASGs
3. Create NSG rules using ASGs as source/destination instead of IP addresses
4. Associate NSGs with subnets or network interfaces

**Example Rule Patterns:**
- **Web to App Tier**: Allow HTTP/HTTPS from Web ASG to Application ASG
- **App to Database**: Allow database protocols from Application ASG to Database ASG
- **Management Access**: Allow administrative protocols from Management ASG to all tiers
- **Internet Access**: Allow outbound internet from specific ASGs

### ASG Best Practices
**Design Principles:**
- **Logical Grouping**: Group VMs based on function, not physical location
- **Granular ASGs**: Create specific ASGs for different application components
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for ASGs
- **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of ASG purpose and membership

**Operational Practices:**
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review ASG membership and rules
- **Automation**: Use ARM templates or scripts for consistent ASG deployment
- **Testing**: Test security rules before applying to production environments
- **Monitoring**: Monitor ASG-based rule effectiveness and performance

**Security Considerations:**
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary access between ASGs
- **Defense in Depth**: Combine ASGs with other security controls
- **Change Management**: Control and audit changes to ASG membership
- **Incident Response**: Plan for security incidents involving ASG-protected resources
