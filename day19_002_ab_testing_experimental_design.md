## 1. A/B Testing Fundamentals

### 1.1 Experimental Design Principles

**The Scientific Method in Product Development**

**Hypothesis-Driven Development**
A/B testing brings scientific rigor to product development:
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Clear, testable hypotheses about system improvements
- **Controlled Experiments**: Isolate the effect of specific changes
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Make decisions based on empirical evidence
- **Iterative Learning**: Continuous learning and improvement cycle

**Key Components of A/B Tests**
- **Treatment**: The new feature, algorithm, or design being tested
- **Control**: The baseline or current system for comparison
- **Random Assignment**: Users randomly assigned to treatment or control
- **Outcome Measurement**: Metrics that measure the impact of the treatment

**Experimental Validity**

**Internal Validity**
Ensuring that observed effects are due to the treatment:
- **Random Assignment**: Eliminates selection bias through randomization
- **Controlled Environment**: Control for confounding variables
- **Temporal Consistency**: Run treatment and control simultaneously
- **Implementation Fidelity**: Ensure treatment is implemented as designed

**External Validity**
Ensuring results generalize beyond the experiment:
- **Representative Sample**: Sample represents target population
- **Realistic Conditions**: Experiment conducted under realistic conditions
- **Temporal Generalizability**: Results hold across different time periods
- **Context Generalizability**: Results apply to different contexts

### 1.2 Statistical Foundations

**Hypothesis Testing Framework**

**Null and Alternative Hypotheses**
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No difference between treatment and control
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Meaningful difference exists
- **One-tailed vs. Two-tailed**: Directional vs. non-directional hypotheses
- **Effect Direction**: Whether we expect positive or negative effects

**Type I and Type II Errors**
- **Type I Error (α)**: False positive - concluding difference when none exists
- **Type II Error (β)**: False negative - missing real difference
- **Statistical Power (1-β)**: Probability of detecting real effect
- **Error Trade-offs**: Balance between Type I and Type II errors

**Statistical Significance and P-values**
- **P-value**: Probability of observing results under null hypothesis
- **Significance Level (α)**: Threshold for statistical significance (typically 0.05)
- **Confidence Intervals**: Range of plausible values for true effect
- **Practical vs. Statistical Significance**: Distinguish meaningful from detectable differences

**Sample Size and Power Analysis**

**Power Analysis Components**
- **Effect Size**: Minimum meaningful difference to detect
- **Statistical Power**: Desired probability of detecting effect (typically 0.8)
- **Significance Level**: Acceptable Type I error rate (typically 0.05)
- **Sample Size**: Number of observations needed for desired power

**Sample Size Calculation**
For comparing two proportions:
- **Formula**: n = 2 × [(Z_α/2 + Z_β)² × p(1-p)] / (p₁ - p₂)²
- **Parameters**: Z-scores, baseline rate (p), effect size (p₁ - p₂)
- **Practical Considerations**: Account for attrition and non-compliance
