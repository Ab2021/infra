## 1. Foundations of Vector Search

### 1.1 From Sparse to Dense Representations

**The Evolution of Information Retrieval**

**Traditional Sparse Representations**
Classical information retrieval relied on sparse, high-dimensional representations:
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Documents represented as sparse vectors of word counts
- **TF-IDF**: Term frequency weighted by inverse document frequency
- **Boolean Models**: Binary representations indicating term presence/absence
- **N-gram Models**: Sparse representations of character or word sequences

**Limitations of Sparse Methods**
- **Vocabulary Mismatch**: Query terms must exactly match document terms
- **Synonymy Problem**: Different words with same meaning treated as unrelated
- **Polysemy Problem**: Same word with different meanings treated identically
- **Context Ignorance**: No understanding of semantic context or relationships

**The Dense Revolution**
Dense representations address fundamental limitations of sparse methods:
- **Semantic Understanding**: Capture semantic relationships between terms and concepts
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Lower-dimensional but more expressive representations
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understand meaning based on surrounding context
- **Generalization**: Better handling of unseen terms and rare words

**Benefits of Dense Retrieval**
- **Semantic Matching**: Match documents based on meaning rather than exact terms
- **Cross-Lingual Capabilities**: Bridge language barriers through shared semantic spaces
- **Robustness**: More robust to vocabulary variations and spelling errors
- **Expressiveness**: Capture complex semantic relationships and nuances

### 1.2 Vector Space Models

**Mathematical Foundations**

**Vector Space Representation**
In vector search, documents and queries are represented as points in high-dimensional space:
- **Document Vectors**: d ∈ ℝⁿ where n is embedding dimension
- **Query Vectors**: q ∈ ℝⁿ in same semantic space as documents
- **Semantic Space**: Learned space where semantic similarity correlates with geometric proximity
- **Embedding Functions**: f_d: Document → ℝⁿ and f_q: Query → ℝⁿ

**Similarity Measures**
Different metrics for measuring similarity in vector space:

**Cosine Similarity**
Most commonly used similarity measure in vector search:
- **Formula**: cos(θ) = (q·d)/(||q|| ||d||)
- **Normalization**: Normalizes for vector magnitude differences
- **Range**: [-1, 1] with 1 indicating perfect similarity
- **Geometric Interpretation**: Angle between vectors in high-dimensional space

**Euclidean Distance**
Direct geometric distance between points:
- **Formula**: ||q - d||₂ = √(Σᵢ(qᵢ - dᵢ)²)
- **Properties**: Sensitive to vector magnitude and scale
- **Inverse Relationship**: Smaller distance indicates higher similarity
- **Use Cases**: When magnitude differences are meaningful

**Dot Product**
Unnormalized similarity measure:
- **Formula**: q·d = Σᵢ qᵢdᵢ
- **Efficiency**: Computationally efficient for similarity computation
- **Magnitude Sensitive**: Affected by vector magnitudes
- **Applications**: When vector norms carry meaningful information
