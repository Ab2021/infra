## Higher-Order Graph Neural Networks

### Theoretical Motivation for Higher-Order Methods

**Limitations of Standard Message Passing**:
Standard GNNs are bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test in terms of expressiveness. They cannot distinguish between certain non-isomorphic graphs that have identical local neighborhood structures.

**k-Weisfeiler-Lehman Hierarchy**:
The k-WL test operates on k-tuples of nodes:
$$WL^k(G) = \{(c_1^{(T)}, c_2^{(T)}, \ldots, c_n^{(T)}) : (c_1^{(0)}, c_2^{(0)}, \ldots, c_n^{(T)}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}\}$$

Higher values of k provide greater expressiveness but at exponential computational cost.

**Motivating Example**: Consider two regular graphs with the same degree sequence but different structural properties. Standard GNNs may produce identical embeddings, while higher-order methods can distinguish them.

### k-GNNs: Higher-Order Message Passing

**k-GNN Framework**:
Instead of operating on individual nodes, k-GNNs operate on k-tuples of nodes:
$$\mathbf{h}_{(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k)}^{(l+1)} = \text{UPDATE}^{(l)}\left(\mathbf{h}_{(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k)}^{(l)}, \text{AGG}^{(l)}\left(\{\mathbf{h}_{(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k)}^{(l)}\}\right)\right)$$

**Neighborhood Definition for k-tuples**:
The neighborhood of a k-tuple $(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k)$ consists of k-tuples that differ in exactly one position and are connected by an edge:
$$\mathcal{N}(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k) = \{(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k) : \exists i \text{ s.t. } (v_i, u_i) \in E \text{ and } u_j = v_j \forall j \neq i\}$$

**Computational Complexity**:
- **Time**: $O(n^k \cdot d)$ per layer for k-tuples
- **Space**: $O(n^k \cdot d)$ for storing k-tuple representations
- **Scalability**: Exponential in k, limiting practical applications

**Invariant Pooling**:
To obtain graph-level representations from k-tuple embeddings:
$$\mathbf{h}_G = \text{POOL}\left(\{\mathbf{h}_{(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k)} : (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k) \in V^k\}\right)$$

Common pooling functions include sum, mean, and max operations that preserve permutation invariance.

### Graph Neural Networks with Higher-Order Pooling

**Hierarchical Pooling Strategies**:
Instead of operating on all k-tuples, use hierarchical approaches:

1. **Edge-based Pooling**: Start with edges (2-tuples), then pool to nodes
2. **Motif-based Pooling**: Pool based on specific structural motifs
3. **Attention-based Selection**: Learn which k-tuples are most important

**Set2Set Pooling**:
A learnable pooling mechanism for sets:
$$\mathbf{q}_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{h}_i$$
$$\mathbf{e}_{i,t} = f_{att}(\mathbf{h}_i, \mathbf{q}_{t-1})$$
$$\alpha_{i,t} = \frac{\exp(\mathbf{e}_{i,t})}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\mathbf{e}_{j,t})}$$
$$\mathbf{r}_t = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_{i,t} \mathbf{h}_i$$
$$\mathbf{q}_t = \text{LSTM}(\mathbf{r}_t, \mathbf{q}_{t-1})$$

This iterative process allows the model to focus on different aspects of the node set at each step.

### Ring-GNNs and Subgraph GNNs

**Ring-GNN Framework**:
Ring-GNNs use ring structures (cycles) as higher-order building blocks:
$$\mathbf{h}_{\text{ring}}^{(l+1)} = \text{UPDATE}\left(\mathbf{h}_{\text{ring}}^{(l)}, \text{AGG}\left(\{\mathbf{h}_v^{(l)} : v \in \text{ring}\}\right)\right)$$

**Benefits**:
- **Expressiveness**: Can capture cyclic dependencies
- **Efficiency**: More efficient than full k-GNNs
- **Interpretability**: Ring structures have clear geometric meaning

**Subgraph GNNs**:
Operate on meaningful subgraphs rather than arbitrary k-tuples:
1. **Subgraph Extraction**: Extract connected subgraphs of size k
2. **Subgraph Embedding**: Learn embeddings for each subgraph
3. **Subgraph Pooling**: Pool subgraph embeddings to node/graph level

**Subgraph Selection Strategies**:
- **BFS/DFS**: Breadth-first or depth-first subgraphs
- **Motif-based**: Focus on specific network motifs
- **Random Sampling**: Randomly sample subgraphs for efficiency

## Graph Transformer Networks

### Extending Transformers to Graphs

**Motivation**: 
Transformers have achieved remarkable success in NLP and vision. The challenge is adapting the self-attention mechanism to handle:
- **Variable graph sizes**: Unlike fixed sequence lengths
- **Irregular structure**: No natural ordering of nodes
- **Large graphs**: Quadratic complexity becomes prohibitive

**Graph Transformer Framework**:
$$\mathbf{H}^{(l+1)} = \text{GraphTransformerLayer}(\mathbf{H}^{(l)}, \mathbf{A})$$

where the layer incorporates both self-attention and graph structure.

### Positional Encodings for Graphs

**Challenge**: Transformers rely on positional encodings, but graphs lack natural ordering.

**Structural Encodings**:

**Laplacian Eigenvectors**:
Use eigenvectors of graph Laplacian as positional encodings:
$$\mathcal{L} \mathbf{u}_k = \lambda_k \mathbf{u}_k$$
$$\mathbf{PE}_{\text{lap}} = [\mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{u}_d]$$

**Random Walk Probabilities**:
Use random walk landing probabilities as positional features:
$$\mathbf{PE}_{\text{rw}}[i,j] = P_k(\text{walk from node } i \text{ lands at node } j)$$

**Shortest Path Distances**:
$$\mathbf{PE}_{\text{sp}}[i,j] = d_{\text{shortest}}(i,j)$$

**Graph-Relative Positional Encoding**:
Learn relative positions based on graph structure:
$$\mathbf{e}_{ij} = f_{\text{pos}}(\text{RELPOS}(i,j))$$

where RELPOS encodes structural relationship between nodes i and j.

### Attention Mechanisms for Graphs

**Structure-Aware Attention**:
Modify standard attention to incorporate graph structure:
$$\text{Attention}(i,j) = \begin{cases}
\frac{\exp(\mathbf{q}_i^T \mathbf{k}_j / \sqrt{d})}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \exp(\mathbf{q}_i^T \mathbf{k}_k / \sqrt{d})} & \text{if } (i,j) \in E \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Global vs Local Attention**:
- **Local**: Attention only over graph neighbors (like GAT)
- **Global**: Attention over all nodes (like standard Transformers)
- **Hybrid**: Combination of local and global attention

**Sparse Attention Patterns**:
For large graphs, use sparse attention patterns:
1. **Random Sparsification**: Randomly select subset of attention connections
2. **Graph-based Sparsification**: Attention follows graph structure
3. **Learned Sparsification**: Learn which attention connections are important

### GraphiT and Other Graph Transformers

**GraphiT Architecture**:
$$\mathbf{H}^{(l+1)} = \mathbf{H}^{(l)} + \text{MHA}(\mathbf{H}^{(l)}, \mathbf{A})$$
$$\mathbf{H}^{(l+1)} = \mathbf{H}^{(l+1)} + \text{FFN}(\mathbf{H}^{(l+1)})$$

where MHA incorporates graph structure in multi-head attention.

**Key Innovations**:
1. **Structural attention bias**: Attention scores biased by graph connectivity
2. **Multi-scale representations**: Different attention heads focus on different hop distances
3. **Adaptive depth**: Dynamic computation based on graph properties

**Graph-Bert**:
Adapts BERT's masked language modeling to graphs:
1. **Node Masking**: Randomly mask node features
2. **Edge Masking**: Randomly remove edges
3. **Graph Structure Prediction**: Predict masked elements

## Temporal Graph Neural Networks

### Dynamic Graph Representation

**Temporal Graph Definition**:
A temporal graph $G_t = (V_t, E_t, X_t)$ evolves over time where:
- $V_t$: Node set at time t (may vary)
- $E_t$: Edge set at time t (may vary)  
- $X_t$: Node/edge features at time t

**Discrete vs Continuous Time**:
- **Discrete**: $G = \{G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_T\}$
- **Continuous**: $G(t)$ for $t \in [0, T]$

**Challenges**:
1. **Temporal Dependencies**: Model how graph structure and features evolve
2. **Variable Topology**: Handle addition/deletion of nodes and edges
3. **Multi-scale Dynamics**: Different processes may operate at different timescales

### Graph Recurrent Neural Networks

**GRU-based Temporal GNNs**:
Combine graph neural networks with recurrent units:
$$\mathbf{h}_{v,t} = \text{GRU}(\mathbf{h}_{v,t-1}, \text{GNN}(\mathbf{x}_{v,t}, \{\mathbf{h}_{u,t-1} : u \in \mathcal{N}_t(v)\}))$$

**LSTM-based Approaches**:
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{f}_t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}_f \cdot [\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, \mathbf{x}_t] + \mathbf{b}_f) \\
\mathbf{i}_t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}_i \cdot [\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, \mathbf{x}_t] + \mathbf{b}_i) \\
\tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t &= \tanh(\mathbf{W}_C \cdot [\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, \mathbf{x}_t] + \mathbf{b}_C) \\
\mathbf{C}_t &= \mathbf{f}_t * \mathbf{C}_{t-1} + \mathbf{i}_t * \tilde{\mathbf{C}}_t \\
\mathbf{o}_t &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}_o \cdot [\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, \mathbf{x}_t] + \mathbf{b}_o) \\
\mathbf{h}_t &= \mathbf{o}_t * \tanh(\mathbf{C}_t)
\end{align}$$

where $\mathbf{x}_t$ incorporates graph-based information at time t.

### Continuous-Time Dynamic Networks

**Neural ODEs for Graphs**:
Model graph dynamics with neural ordinary differential equations:
$$\frac{d\mathbf{h}_v(t)}{dt} = f(\mathbf{h}_v(t), \{\mathbf{h}_u(t) : u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}, t; \boldsymbol{\theta})$$

**Temporal Graph Networks (TGN)**:
Process temporal graphs with continuous-time embeddings:
1. **Memory Module**: Maintain evolving node memories
2. **Message Function**: Generate messages for interacting nodes
3. **Memory Updater**: Update node memories based on messages
4. **Embedding Module**: Generate node embeddings from memories

**Mathematical Framework**:
$$\mathbf{m}_v(t) = \text{msg}(\mathbf{s}_v(t^-), \mathbf{s}_u(t^-), \Delta t, \mathbf{e}_{uv}(t))$$
$$\mathbf{s}_v(t) = \text{update}(\mathbf{s}_v(t^-), \mathbf{m}_v(t))$$
$$\mathbf{z}_v(t) = \text{embed}(\mathbf{s}_v(t))$$

where $\mathbf{s}_v(t)$ is node v's memory and $\mathbf{z}_v(t)$ is its embedding.

## Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks

### Multi-Relational Graph Modeling

**Heterogeneous Graph Definition**:
A heterogeneous graph $G = (V, E, \phi, \psi)$ where:
- $\phi: V \rightarrow \mathcal{T}_V$: Node type mapping
- $\psi: E \rightarrow \mathcal{T}_E$: Edge type mapping
- Multiple node types: $|\mathcal{T}_V| > 1$
- Multiple edge types: $|\mathcal{T}_E| > 1$

**Relation-Specific Parameters**:
Different parameters for different relation types:
$$\mathbf{h}_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}_r(v)} \frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}_r(v)|} \mathbf{W}_r^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_u^{(l)}\right)$$

where $\mathcal{N}_r(v)$ is the set of neighbors connected via relation type r.

### R-GCN (Relational Graph Convolutional Networks)

**R-GCN Layer**:
$$\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\mathbf{W}_0^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} + \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i^r} \frac{1}{c_{i,r}} \mathbf{W}_r^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_j^{(l)}\right)$$

where:
- $\mathbf{W}_0^{(l)}$: Self-connection weight
- $\mathbf{W}_r^{(l)}$: Relation-specific weight matrix
- $c_{i,r}$: Normalization constant

**Parameter Sharing Strategies**:
To reduce parameters for large numbers of relations:

**Block Diagonal Decomposition**:
$$\mathbf{W}_r^{(l)} = \text{diag}(\mathbf{B}_1^{(l)}, \mathbf{B}_2^{(l)}, \ldots, \mathbf{B}_B^{(l)})$$

**Basis Decomposition**:
$$\mathbf{W}_r^{(l)} = \sum_{b=1}^{B} a_{rb}^{(l)} \mathbf{V}_b^{(l)}$$

where $\mathbf{V}_b^{(l)}$ are learned basis matrices and $a_{rb}^{(l)}$ are coefficients.

### HAN (Heterogeneous Attention Network)

**Hierarchical Attention**:
HAN uses two levels of attention:
1. **Node-level Attention**: Within each meta-path
2. **Semantic-level Attention**: Across different meta-paths

**Meta-path Based Neighbors**:
For meta-path $\Phi = A_1 \xrightarrow{R_1} A_2 \xrightarrow{R_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{R_{|\Phi|-1}} A_{|\Phi|}$:
$$\mathcal{N}_i^{\Phi} = \{j : i \xrightarrow{\Phi} j\}$$

**Node-level Attention**:
$$\alpha_{ij}^{\Phi} = \frac{\exp(\sigma(\mathbf{a}_{\Phi}^T [\mathbf{W}_{\Phi} \mathbf{h}_i \| \mathbf{W}_{\Phi} \mathbf{h}_j]))}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}_i^{\Phi}} \exp(\sigma(\mathbf{a}_{\Phi}^T [\mathbf{W}_{\Phi} \mathbf{h}_i \| \mathbf{W}_{\Phi} \mathbf{h}_k]))}$$

**Meta-path Specific Embedding**:
$$\mathbf{z}_i^{\Phi} = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i^{\Phi}} \alpha_{ij}^{\Phi} \mathbf{W}_{\Phi} \mathbf{h}_j$$

**Semantic-level Attention**:
$$\beta_{\Phi} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{V}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \mathbf{q}^T \tanh(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{z}_i^{\Phi} + \mathbf{b})$$
$$\alpha_{\Phi} = \frac{\exp(\beta_{\Phi})}{\sum_{\Phi' \in \mathcal{P}} \exp(\beta_{\Phi'})}$$

**Final Embedding**:
$$\mathbf{z}_i = \sum_{\Phi \in \mathcal{P}} \alpha_{\Phi} \mathbf{z}_i^{\Phi}$$

## Scalability and Efficiency

### Large-Scale Graph Processing

**Memory Bottlenecks**:
1. **Adjacency Matrix Storage**: $O(|V|^2)$ for dense graphs
2. **Node Embeddings**: $O(|V| \cdot d)$ where d is embedding dimension
3. **Intermediate Activations**: $O(L \cdot |V| \cdot d)$ for L layers

**Sampling Strategies**:

**FastGCN**: 
Sample nodes instead of neighbors:
$$\mathbf{H}^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\hat{\mathbf{A}}^{(l)} \mathbf{H}^{(l)} \mathbf{W}^{(l)}\right)$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{A}}^{(l)}$ is constructed from sampled nodes.

**Control Variate Sampling**:
Reduce variance in sampling-based methods:
$$\hat{f}_{CV} = \hat{f}_{MC} - \alpha(\hat{g}_{MC} - \mathbb{E}[g])$$

where $\hat{f}_{MC}$ is Monte Carlo estimate and $g$ is control variate.

### Distributed Graph Neural Networks

**Graph Partitioning**:
Partition large graphs across multiple devices:
1. **Edge-Cut Minimization**: Minimize edges crossing partitions
2. **Load Balancing**: Ensure roughly equal partition sizes
3. **Communication Minimization**: Reduce inter-partition communication

**Distributed Training Strategies**:

**Parameter Servers**:
- Central parameter storage
- Workers compute gradients on local graph partitions
- Synchronous or asynchronous updates

**All-Reduce**:
- Decentralized gradient aggregation
- Ring-based or tree-based communication patterns
- Better scaling properties for large numbers of workers

**Gradient Compression**:
Reduce communication overhead:
$$\tilde{\mathbf{g}} = \text{compress}(\mathbf{g})$$

Common compression techniques:
- **Quantization**: Reduce precision of gradient values
- **Sparsification**: Send only top-k gradients
- **Error Feedback**: Accumulate compression errors

$$\mathbf{x}_i^{(l+1)} = \mathbf{x}_i^{(l)} + \sum_{j \neq i} \mathbf{x}_j^{(l)} \odot f(\|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j\|)$$

where $f$ is a continuous filter and $\mathbf{r}_i$ are atomic positions.

**DimeNet** (Directional Message Passing):
Incorporates bond angles in message passing:
$$\mathbf{m}_{ji \leftarrow k} = f_{\text{msg}}(\mathbf{h}_j, \mathbf{h}_k, \mathbf{e}_{ji}, \mathbf{e}_{ki}, \angle(j,i,k))$$

**Challenges in Molecular Modeling**:

2. **Chirality**: Handling stereochemistry
3. **Conformations**: Multiple 3D arrangements
4. **Quantum Effects**: Beyond classical molecular mechanics

### Social Network Analysis

**Social Graph Characteristics**:
- **Scale-free**: Power-law degree distribution
- **Small-world**: Short path lengths, high clustering
- **Homophily**: Similar nodes tend to connect
- **Community Structure**: Dense within-group connections

**Specialized Tasks**:

**Influence Prediction**:
Predict how information spreads through network:
$$P(\text{node } v \text{ adopts} | \text{neighbors' states}) = \sigma\left(\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} w_{uv} \mathbf{h}_u\right)$$

**Community Detection**:
Use GNN embeddings for clustering:
$$\mathbf{Z} = \text{GNN}(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{A})$$
$$\text{Communities} = \text{Cluster}(\mathbf{Z})$$

**Link Prediction in Social Networks**:
$$P(\text{edge}(i,j)) = \sigma(\mathbf{z}_i^T \mathbf{z}_j)$$

where $\mathbf{z}_i$ and $\mathbf{z}_j$ are node embeddings.

### Knowledge Graph Reasoning

**Knowledge Graph Structure**:
- **Entities**: Real-world objects
- **Relations**: Relationships between entities
- **Triples**: (head entity, relation, tail entity)

**Embedding-based Methods**:

**TransE**:
$$\mathbf{h} + \mathbf{r} \approx \mathbf{t}$$

for positive triples (h,r,t).

**RotatE**:
$$\mathbf{t} = \mathbf{h} \circ \mathbf{r}$$

where $\circ$ is element-wise complex multiplication.

**GNN-based KG Reasoning**:

**CompGCN**:
$$\mathbf{h}_u^{(l+1)} = f\left(\sum_{(r,v) \in \mathcal{N}(u)} \mathbf{W}_{\lambda(r)}^{(l)} (\mathbf{h}_v^{(l)} \circ \mathbf{h}_r^{(l)})\right)$$

where $\lambda(r)$ indicates relation direction and $\circ$ is composition operation.

### Scientific Computing Applications

**Physics-Informed GNNs**:
Incorporate physical laws into GNN architectures:
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$ enforces physical constraints.

**Mesh-based Simulations**:
Use GNNs for finite element analysis:

- **Multi-scale Interactions**: Couple different physical processes
- **Long-term Dependencies**: Model climate patterns over time

## Theoretical Advances

### Graph Neural Tangent Kernels

**Neural Tangent Kernel Theory**:
For infinite-width neural networks, training dynamics are governed by:
$$\frac{d}{dt} f(\mathbf{x}; \boldsymbol{\theta}(t)) = \eta \sum_{i=1}^{n} K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_i) (y_i - f(\mathbf{x}_i; \boldsymbol{\theta}(t)))$$

where $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')$ is the Neural Tangent Kernel.

**Graph Neural Tangent Kernel**:
Extension to graphs where kernel depends on graph structure:
$$K_G(G, G') = \langle \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} f(G; \boldsymbol{\theta}), \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} f(G'; \boldsymbol{\theta}) \rangle$$

**Theoretical Implications**:
- Provides theoretical understanding of GNN training dynamics
- Explains generalization properties
- Guides architecture design choices

### Equivariance and Invariance Theory

**Group Equivariance**:
For group $G$ acting on graphs, GNN $f$ is equivariant if:
$$f(g \cdot \mathcal{G}) = \rho(g) \cdot f(\mathcal{G})$$

where $\rho$ is representation of group action on output space.

**Permutation Equivariance**:
Most fundamental requirement for GNNs:
$$f(\pi \cdot \mathcal{G}) = \pi \cdot f(\mathcal{G})$$

for any permutation $\pi$ of nodes.

**E(3) Equivariant GNNs**:
For molecular applications, respect 3D Euclidean group:
- **Translations**: $f(\mathcal{G} + \mathbf{t}) = f(\mathcal{G}) + T(\mathbf{t})$
- **Rotations**: $f(R \cdot \mathcal{G}) = R \cdot f(\mathcal{G})$
- **Reflections**: Handle chirality appropriately
