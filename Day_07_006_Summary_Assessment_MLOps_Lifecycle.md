Component Integration Patterns:
1. Event-Driven Architecture:
   - Model lifecycle events trigger downstream actions
   - Pub/sub messaging for loose coupling
   - Event sourcing for audit trails
   - CQRS pattern for read/write optimization

2. Microservices Architecture:
   - Domain-driven service boundaries
   - API-first design with versioning
   - Circuit breaker and retry patterns
   - Service mesh for cross-cutting concerns

3. Data Mesh Architecture:
   - Domain-oriented data ownership
   - Self-serve data infrastructure
   - Federated governance model
   - Data products as first-class citizens
```

**Scalability and Performance Patterns:**
```
Horizontal Scaling Strategies:
1. Stateless Service Design:
   - Externalize state to databases/caches
   - Immutable infrastructure patterns
   - Load balancing across service instances
   - Auto-scaling based on metrics

2. Data Partitioning:
   - Horizontal partitioning by feature/time
   - Consistent hashing for data distribution
   - Read replicas for query scaling
   - Caching layers for frequently accessed data

3. Compute Scaling:
   - Kubernetes HPA/VPA for dynamic scaling
   - Spot instances for cost optimization
   - Multi-cloud deployment for availability
   - Edge computing for latency optimization

Performance Optimization:
Resource Utilization Targets:
- CPU Utilization: 70-80% (leave headroom for spikes)
- Memory Utilization: <85% (prevent OOM conditions)
- GPU Utilization: >85% (expensive resources, maximize usage)
- Network Bandwidth: <70% (handle traffic bursts)
- Storage IOPS: Match application requirements

Latency Requirements by Use Case:
- Real-time recommendations: <50ms P99
- Fraud detection: <100ms P99
- Content moderation: <500ms P99
- Batch analytics: <1 hour SLA
- Model training: <24 hours for most models
```

### **Cost Optimization Framework**

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis:**
```
MLOps TCO Components:
Infrastructure Costs (40-60%):
- Compute: Training clusters, inference servers
- Storage: Data lakes, model artifacts, logs
- Network: Data transfer, API calls
- Management: Monitoring, backup, security

Personnel Costs (30-40%):
- Data scientists: Model development and research
- ML engineers: Pipeline development and maintenance
- DevOps engineers: Infrastructure management
- Data engineers: Data pipeline development

Operational Costs (10-20%):
- Tool licensing: MLOps platforms, monitoring tools
- Compliance: Audit, legal, regulatory requirements
- Training: Employee skill development
- Vendor management: Third-party service costs

Cost Optimization Strategies:
1. Resource Right-Sizing:
   - Profile actual resource usage vs allocated
   - Use vertical pod autoscaling for optimization
   - Implement resource quotas and limits
   - Regular review and adjustment cycles

2. Workload Optimization:
   - Spot instances for fault-tolerant training
   - Reserved instances for predictable workloads
   - Multi-cloud arbitrage for cost savings
   - Scheduled scaling for time-varying loads

3. Data Management:
   - Intelligent data tiering (hot/warm/cold)
   - Data compression and deduplication
   - Automated data lifecycle management
   - Query optimization and indexing

Cost Optimization Metrics:
Cost_per_Model = (Infrastructure_Cost + Personnel_Cost) / Number_of_Models
Cost_per_Prediction = Total_Serving_Cost / Number_of_Predictions
Training_Efficiency = Model_Quality_Improvement / Training_Cost
ROI = (Business_Value - Total_Cost) / Total_Cost
```
