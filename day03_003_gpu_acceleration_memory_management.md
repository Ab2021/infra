hidden_states = torch.empty(batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size, device='cuda')
attention_weights = torch.empty(batch_size, 12, seq_len, seq_len, device='cuda')

# Reuse pre-allocated tensors
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        # Reuse existing tensors rather than creating new ones
        hidden_states.copy_(batch.hidden)
        # ... training logic
```

**Memory Pool Management**
