## Cloud Network Security Overview

### Definition and Scope
Cloud network security encompasses the policies, procedures, technologies, and controls deployed to protect cloud-based network infrastructure, data in transit, and network access points. Unlike traditional on-premises networks with clearly defined perimeters, cloud networks operate in a shared, virtualized environment where security boundaries are software-defined and dynamic.

### Key Characteristics of Cloud Networks
- **Software-Defined Perimeters**: Security boundaries are created through software configurations rather than physical devices
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Network resources can be provisioned and de-provisioned automatically based on demand
- **Global Distribution**: Resources can be distributed across multiple geographic regions and availability zones
- **API-Driven Management**: Network configurations are managed through APIs, enabling automation and Infrastructure-as-Code approaches
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Multiple tenants share the same underlying physical infrastructure while maintaining logical isolation

### Evolution from Traditional Network Security
Traditional network security relied heavily on perimeter-based models with firewalls at network boundaries. Cloud environments have shifted this paradigm in several ways:

1. **Perimeter Dissolution**: The traditional network perimeter has dissolved as applications and data move to the cloud
2. **Identity-Centric Security**: Access control shifts from network-based to identity-based authentication and authorization
3. **Micro-Segmentation**: Instead of large network zones, granular segmentation occurs at the workload or application level
4. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Trust is never assumed and verification is required for every access attempt

## Shared Responsibility Model

### Understanding Shared Responsibility
The cloud shared responsibility model divides security responsibilities between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the customer. This division varies based on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and affects network security implementation.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Responsibilities
**Cloud Provider Responsibilities:**
- Physical network infrastructure security
- Hypervisor-level network isolation
- DDoS protection at the infrastructure level

- Operating system network stack security
- Application-level network security
- Network traffic encryption
- Network monitoring and logging configuration

### Platform as a Service (PaaS) Responsibilities
**Cloud Provider Responsibilities:**
- All IaaS responsibilities
- Platform network configuration and management
- Service-level network security controls
- Inter-service communication security

**Customer Responsibilities:**

- **Model Communication**: Securing communication between distributed training nodes
- **Inference Endpoint Security**: Protecting API endpoints that serve ML models
- **Data Pipeline Security**: Securing ETL processes and data movement between storage and compute

## Cloud Network Architecture Patterns

### Hub-and-Spoke Architecture
The hub-and-spoke model centralizes shared services in a hub virtual network while connecting spoke networks for specific applications or business units.

**Advantages:**
- Centralized security policy enforcement
- Simplified network management
- Cost-effective for shared services
- Clear separation of concerns

**Security Benefits:**
- Central point for security monitoring and logging
- Consistent policy application across spokes
- Reduced attack surface through centralization
- Easier compliance auditing

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Hub network hosts shared security services (firewalls, VPN gateways, DNS)
- Spoke networks contain application-specific resources
- Transit routing can be controlled through the hub
- Network peering or transit gateways connect hub and spokes

### Mesh Architecture
In a mesh architecture, multiple virtual networks are interconnected, allowing direct communication between any two networks.

**Advantages:**
- Reduced latency between networks
- Eliminated single point of failure
- Flexible traffic routing
- Better suited for distributed applications

**Security Challenges:**
- Complex policy management across multiple connections
- Increased attack surface due to multiple paths
- Difficult to implement centralized security controls
- Network segmentation becomes more complex

**AI/ML Use Cases:**
Mesh architectures are particularly relevant for distributed AI/ML workloads where:
- Multiple training clusters need to communicate directly
- Data lakes are distributed across regions
- Real-time inference requires low-latency communication

### Multi-Tier Architecture
Multi-tier architectures separate different application layers (web, application, database) into distinct network segments.

**Traditional Three-Tier Model:**
1. **Presentation Tier**: Web servers and load balancers
2. **Application Tier**: Application servers and business logic
3. **Data Tier**: Databases and data storage systems

**Modern Cloud-Native Variations:**
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service in its own network segment
- **Serverless Architecture**: Function-based segmentation
- **Container Architecture**: Pod or container-based network isolation

**Security Implementation:**
- Each tier has specific security requirements and controls
- Traffic flow is typically unidirectional from presentation to data tier
- Network access control lists (NACLs) restrict inter-tier communication
- Application-layer firewalls provide additional protection

### Zero Trust Network Architecture
Zero Trust assumes no implicit trust and requires verification for every access request, regardless of location.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every access request must be authenticated and authorized
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Users and systems receive minimum necessary permissions
3. **Assume Breach**: Design systems assuming attackers are already inside the network

**Implementation Components:**
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Strong authentication and authorization
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Granular network segmentation
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of network traffic and behavior
- **Policy Enforcement Points**: Dynamic policy enforcement throughout the network

## Virtual Network Fundamentals

### Virtual Network Concepts
Virtual networks create logical network boundaries within cloud infrastructure, providing isolation and segmentation without physical hardware dependencies.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Software-Defined**: Created and managed through software rather than physical hardware
- **Isolated**: Logically separated from other virtual networks
- **Elastic**: Can be dynamically resized and reconfigured
- **Programmable**: Managed through APIs and Infrastructure-as-Code

### Subnets and Address Spaces
Subnets divide virtual networks into smaller, manageable segments with specific purposes and security requirements.

**Public Subnets:**
- Contain resources that need direct internet access
- Typically host load balancers, NAT gateways, and bastion hosts
- Route traffic through internet gateways
- Require careful security controls due to internet exposure

**Private Subnets:**
- Contain internal resources without direct internet access
- Host application servers, databases, and internal services
- Access internet through NAT gateways or VPN connections
- Provide additional security through network isolation

**Address Space Planning:**
- Use RFC 1918 private IP address ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)
- Plan for future growth and avoid overlapping address spaces
- Consider compliance requirements for network segmentation
- Account for peering and connectivity with other networks

### Routing and Traffic Flow
Cloud networks use routing tables to control traffic flow between subnets and external networks.

**Route Table Components:**
- **Destination**: The target IP address range or specific address
- **Target**: Where traffic should be sent (gateway, instance, or local)
- **Priority**: Used when multiple routes match the same destination

**Common Route Types:**
- **Local Routes**: Traffic within the virtual network
- **Internet Gateway Routes**: Traffic to and from the internet
- **NAT Gateway Routes**: Outbound internet traffic from private subnets
- **VPN Gateway Routes**: Traffic to on-premises networks
- **Peering Routes**: Traffic to other virtual networks

### Network Segmentation Strategies
Effective segmentation isolates different types of traffic and reduces the potential blast radius of security incidents.

**Functional Segmentation:**
- Separate networks based on application function
- Example: Web tier, application tier, database tier
- Reduces lateral movement opportunities for attackers

**Environmental Segmentation:**
- Separate development, testing, and production environments
- Prevents accidental cross-environment access
- Supports compliance requirements for data protection

**Organizational Segmentation:**
- Separate networks based on business units or departments
- Supports multi-tenant environments
- Enables different security policies for different groups

**Data Classification Segmentation:**
- Separate networks based on data sensitivity levels
- Public, internal, confidential, and restricted data classifications
- Enables appropriate security controls for each classification level

## Security Group vs Network ACL Concepts

### Security Groups (Stateful Filtering)
Security groups act as virtual firewalls for individual resources, providing stateful packet filtering at the instance level.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stateful**: Return traffic is automatically allowed for established connections
- **Instance-Level**: Applied directly to compute instances or network interfaces
- **Allow Rules Only**: Can only specify allow rules; deny is implicit for unspecified traffic
- **Evaluates All Rules**: All applicable rules are evaluated to determine access

**Rule Components:**
- **Type**: The type of traffic (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, custom)
- **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, or custom protocol numbers
- **Port Range**: Specific ports or port ranges
- **Source/Destination**: IP addresses, CIDR blocks, or other security groups

**Best Practices:**
- Apply the principle of least privilege in rule definitions
- Use descriptive names and descriptions for rules
- Regularly audit and remove unnecessary rules
- Group similar resources to share security group configurations

### Network Access Control Lists (Stateless Filtering)
Network ACLs provide stateless packet filtering at the subnet level, evaluating each packet independently.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stateless**: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed
- **Subnet-Level**: Applied to entire subnets rather than individual instances
- **Allow and Deny Rules**: Can specify both allow and deny rules
- **Rule Order Matters**: Rules are evaluated in numerical order

**Rule Evaluation Process:**
1. Rules are processed in ascending numerical order
2. First matching rule determines the action (allow or deny)
3. If no rules match, traffic is denied by default
4. Lower-numbered rules take precedence over higher-numbered rules

**Use Cases:**
- Subnet-level security controls
- Compliance requirements for network-level filtering
- Defense in depth strategy alongside security groups
- Emergency traffic blocking capabilities

### Comparison and When to Use Each

**Security Groups Best For:**
- Application-specific access controls
- Dynamic environments with frequent changes
- Micro-segmentation at the instance level
- Simplified rule management for most use cases

**Network ACLs Best For:**
- Subnet-level security controls
- Compliance requirements for network-level filtering
- Emergency traffic blocking
- Additional layer of defense

**Layered Security Approach:**
Combining both security groups and network ACLs provides defense in depth:
1. Network ACLs provide coarse-grained filtering at the subnet level
2. Security groups provide fine-grained filtering at the instance level
3. This combination reduces the attack surface and provides multiple points of control
