V ‚àà ‚Ñù^{T√óH√óW√óC} where T is temporal dimension
Temporal axis adds new dimension to image diffusion
Requires modeling temporal dependencies alongside spatial structure

q(v_{1:S} | v_0) = ‚àè_{s=1}^S q(v_s | v_{s-1})
where s indexes diffusion timesteps (not video frames)
Each v_s ‚àà ‚Ñù^{T√óH√óW√óC} is noisy video

Frame-wise vs Video-wise Diffusion:

## üéØ Advanced Understanding Questions

### Temporal Coherence Theory:
1. **Q**: Analyze the mathematical relationship between temporal receptive field size and motion modeling capability in 3D U-Net architectures, deriving optimal kernel sizes for different motion complexities.
   **A**: Mathematical relationship: temporal receptive field RF_t = 1 + Œ£_l(k_t^l - 1) determines maximum detectable motion span. Motion complexity analysis: simple linear motion requires RF_t ‚â• 2√ómotion_speed, complex non-linear motion requires larger RF_t for trajectory modeling. Optimal kernel sizes: k_t = 3 for local motion, k_t = 5-7 for medium-range dependencies, k_t > 7 for complex interactions. Trade-offs: larger kernels increase computational cost O(k_t¬≥) but improve motion modeling. Application-dependent optimization: fast motion scenes need larger RF_t, static scenes can use smaller kernels. Theoretical insight: optimal RF_t should match temporal correlation length in video content.

2. **Q**: Develop a theoretical framework for analyzing information flow in spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, considering computational efficiency and temporal dependency modeling.
   **A**: Framework components: (1) spatial information I_spatial within frames, (2) temporal information I_temporal across frames, (3) computational complexity O(T¬≤HW). Information flow analysis: spatial attention processes I_spatial with complexity O(H¬≤W¬≤), temporal attention processes I_temporal with complexity O(T¬≤). Efficiency analysis: separable spatio-temporal attention reduces complexity from O(T¬≤H¬≤W¬≤) to O(T¬≤HW + H¬≤W¬≤T). Dependency modeling: full attention captures all temporal relationships, sparse attention trades completeness for efficiency. Optimal design: use dense attention for critical temporal relationships, sparse attention for background consistency. Theoretical insight: attention pattern should match temporal correlation structure for optimal information utilization.

3. **Q**: Compare the mathematical foundations of different temporal consistency constraints (warping, flow, perceptual) in video diffusion models, analyzing their impact on generation quality and computational cost.
   **A**: Mathematical comparison: warping loss ||I_{t+1} - W(I_t, F_t)||¬≤ enforces geometric consistency, flow loss ensures motion field accuracy, perceptual loss captures semantic temporal relationships. Quality impact: warping prevents geometric artifacts, flow constraints ensure motion realism, perceptual loss improves semantic consistency. Computational cost: warping requires optical flow estimation O(HW), flow loss adds optimization complexity, perceptual loss needs deep network forward passes. Theoretical trade-offs: warping assumes brightness constancy (often violated), flow estimation errors propagate, perceptual loss may be less precise spatially. Optimal combination: weighted ensemble based on content characteristics and application requirements. Key insight: different constraints address different aspects of temporal quality, requiring careful balance.

### Motion Modeling Theory:
4. **Q**: Analyze the mathematical principles behind optical flow integration in video diffusion models, developing theoretical frameworks for motion-aware generation quality.
   **A**: Mathematical principles: optical flow v(x,y,t) provides dense motion field constraining temporal evolution. Integration methods: (1) flow conditioning in diffusion process, (2) flow-based warping losses, (3) motion-aware noise scheduling. Quality framework: Q_motion = f(flow_accuracy, temporal_consistency, motion_realism). Flow accuracy: measured by endpoint error between estimated and ground truth flow. Temporal consistency: assessed through warping error ||I_{t+1} - W(I_t, F_t)||¬≤. Motion realism: evaluated using motion statistics and perceptual metrics. Theoretical benefits: explicit motion modeling reduces temporal artifacts, enables motion transfer, supports physics-aware generation. Limitations: flow estimation errors, occlusion handling, computational overhead. Key insight: motion-aware generation requires balancing explicit motion constraints with generative flexibility.

5. **Q**: Develop a mathematical theory for error accumulation in autoregressive video generation, deriving bounds on sequence length and quality degradation.
   **A**: Mathematical theory: autoregressive error Œµ_t = f(Œµ_{t-1}, generation_error_t) accumulates over time. Error bounds: under Lipschitz continuity ||Œµ_t|| ‚â§ L^t||Œµ_0|| + Œ£_{i=1}^t L^{t-i}||Œ¥_i|| where L is Lipschitz constant, Œ¥_i are generation errors. Quality degradation: Q(t) = Q_0 √ó exp(-Œ±√ót) for exponential decay model. Sequence length limits: practical limit when Q(t) < threshold, theoretical limit when error variance exceeds signal variance. Mitigation strategies: (1) hierarchical generation reduces L, (2) periodic keyframes reset error accumulation, (3) consistency losses constrain error growth. Theoretical bounds: maximum sequence length ‚àù 1/Œ± where Œ± depends on model quality and content complexity. Key insight: autoregressive approaches fundamentally limited by error accumulation, requiring specialized techniques for long sequences.

6. **Q**: Compare the information-theoretic properties of different long video generation strategies (autoregressive, hierarchical, chunk-based), analyzing their fundamental capabilities and limitations.
   **A**: Information-theoretic comparison: autoregressive maximizes I(I_t; I_{<t}) through full temporal conditioning, hierarchical factorizes I(I_{1:T}) into keyframe and interpolation components, chunk-based processes I_local with limited temporal context. Capabilities: autoregressive captures full temporal dependencies but suffers error accumulation, hierarchical enables parallel processing with controlled error propagation, chunk-based scales to arbitrary length with local consistency. Limitations: autoregressive limited by error accumulation, hierarchical may miss fine temporal details, chunk-based may have boundary artifacts. Fundamental trade-offs: temporal dependency modeling vs computational efficiency, sequence length vs quality maintenance, parallelization vs temporal consistency. Optimal strategy: depends on sequence length requirements, computational constraints, and quality priorities. Key insight: no single approach optimal for all scenarios, requiring hybrid strategies for best performance.

### Quality Assessment Theory:
7. **Q**: Design a mathematical framework for unified video quality assessment that captures both spatial and temporal quality dimensions while correlating with human perception.
   **A**: Framework components: (1) spatial quality Q_s per frame, (2) temporal consistency Q_t between frames, (3) motion quality Q_m for dynamics, (4) semantic coherence Q_sem for content. Mathematical formulation: Q_unified = Œ±‚ÇÅQ_s + Œ±‚ÇÇQ_t + Œ±‚ÇÉQ_m + Œ±‚ÇÑQ_sem where weights optimize correlation with human judgment. Spatial quality: combines sharpness, artifact detection, aesthetic appeal. Temporal consistency: warping error, flow consistency, perceptual temporal distance. Motion quality: motion realism, trajectory smoothness, physics consistency. Semantic coherence: object identity preservation, narrative consistency, scene logic. Human correlation: optimize weights through regression on human preference data. Multi-dimensional assessment: different applications emphasize different dimensions. Key insight: unified quality assessment requires balancing multiple competing aspects of video quality based on application needs and human perceptual priorities.

8. **Q**: Develop a unified mathematical theory connecting video generation quality to fundamental principles of human temporal perception and motion processing.
   **A**: Unified theory: video quality determined by alignment with human visual system (HVS) temporal processing characteristics. Temporal perception: motion detection thresholds, temporal resolution limits, flicker sensitivity inform quality metrics. Motion processing: biological motion perception, optical flow processing, attention to moving objects affect quality judgment. Mathematical framework: Q = Œ≤‚ÇÅ√óMotion_naturalness + Œ≤‚ÇÇ√óTemporal_smoothness + Œ≤‚ÇÉ√óAttention_consistency where terms incorporate HVS models. Motion naturalness: alignment with biological motion statistics and physics principles. Temporal smoothness: respect for HVS temporal filtering and integration characteristics. Attention consistency: proper motion-attention coupling based on visual psychology. Perceptual optimization: prioritize quality improvements in perceptually important temporal frequencies and motion patterns. Theoretical insight: optimal video generation should respect both low-level temporal processing and high-level motion understanding in human vision. Key finding: quality assessment must integrate temporal perception research with generation model evaluation.
