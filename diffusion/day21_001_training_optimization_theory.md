## 🎯 Speedup Techniques Mathematical Framework

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Theory

#### Mathematical Foundation of EMA
**EMA Update Mechanism**:
```
EMA Definition:
θ_ema(t) = β × θ_ema(t-1) + (1-β) × θ(t)
β: momentum parameter (typically 0.999 or 0.9999)
θ(t): current model parameters at training step t
θ_ema(t): EMA parameters at step t

Recursive Expansion:
θ_ema(t) = (1-β) × Σ_{i=0}^{t} β^i × θ(t-i)
Exponential weighting: recent parameters weighted more heavily
Effective window: W_eff ≈ 1/(1-β) training steps

Mathematical Properties:
- Bias correction: θ̂_ema(t) = θ_ema(t) / (1 - β^{t+1})
- Variance reduction: Var[θ_ema] < Var[θ] due to smoothing
- Memory efficiency: O(1) storage, O(1) update computation
- Temporal smoothing: reduces high-frequency parameter oscillations
```

**Theoretical Analysis of EMA Benefits**:
```
Optimization Landscape Smoothing:
EMA parameters follow smoother trajectory in parameter space
Reduces impact of noisy gradient estimates
Improves generalization through implicit regularization

Convergence Analysis:
For convex objectives: θ_ema converges to optimum
For non-convex: reduces oscillation around local minima
Effective learning rate: η_eff = η × (1-β) for smooth objectives

Statistical Properties:
Bias: E[θ_ema - θ*] decreases with larger β
Variance: Var[θ_ema] = (1-β)²/(1+β) × Var[θ]
MSE trade-off: balance between bias and variance
Optimal β: depends on noise level and convergence requirements

Information-Theoretic View:
EMA acts as low-pass filter on parameter updates
Preserves low-frequency (trend) information
Attenuates high-frequency (noise) components
Bandwidth: determined by β parameter
```

Improved FID scores: consistent performance across evaluations
Robust to hyperparameter choices: reduces sensitivity to learning rate

Mathematical Framework:
Training objective: L(θ) = E_t,x,ε[||ε - ε_θ(x_t, t)||²]
EMA update: θ_ema ← β θ_ema + (1-β) θ
Generation: x̂ = sample(ε_θ_ema, x_T, {t_i})

Theoretical Guarantees:
Under Lipschitz loss: ||θ_ema(t) - θ*|| ≤ O(1/√t)

### Speedup Techniques Theory:
1. **Q**: Analyze the mathematical relationship between EMA momentum parameter β and training stability in diffusion models, deriving optimal β values for different training scenarios.
   **A**: Mathematical relationship: EMA variance reduction Var[θ_ema] = (1-β)²/(1+β) × Var[θ], while bias E[θ_ema - θ*] ∝ β. Training stability improves with higher β due to parameter smoothing, but too high β causes slow adaptation. Optimal β analysis: for stable training with learning rate η and gradient variance σ², optimal β ≈ 1 - η/σ balances bias-variance trade-off. Different scenarios: large models need higher β (0.9999) for stability, small models can use lower β (0.999) for faster adaptation, fine-tuning requires lower β for rapid adjustment.
