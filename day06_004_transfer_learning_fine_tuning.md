# Day 6.4: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning

## Overview
Transfer learning represents one of the most practically important and theoretically fascinating aspects of modern deep learning, enabling practitioners to leverage pre-trained models for new tasks with dramatically reduced computational requirements and training time. This approach has fundamentally transformed computer vision by making sophisticated models accessible even with limited data and computational resources. The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of transfer learning encompass optimization theory, feature representation analysis, domain adaptation, and knowledge distillation, providing a rich framework for understanding how neural networks can adapt learned representations across different but related tasks.

## Mathematical Foundations of Transfer Learning

### Theoretical Framework

**Domain and Task Definition**
In transfer learning, we formally define:

**Source Domain**: $\mathcal{D}_S = \{\mathcal{X}_S, P(X_S)\}$
**Target Domain**: $\mathcal{D}_T = \{\mathcal{X}_T, P(X_T)\}$

**Source Task**: $\mathcal{T}_S = \{\mathcal{Y}_S, P(Y_S|X_S)\}$
**Target Task**: $\mathcal{T}_T = \{\mathcal{Y}_T, P(Y_T|X_T)\}$

**Transfer Learning Objective**:
Given source domain $\mathcal{D}_S$ and learning task $\mathcal{T}_S$, improve learning of target task $\mathcal{T}_T$ in target domain $\mathcal{D}_T$ using knowledge gained from $\mathcal{D}_S$ and $\mathcal{T}_S$.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{transfer} = \arg \min_{\theta_T} \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{T}_T, f_{\theta_T}) + \lambda \Omega(f_{\theta_T}, f_{\theta_S})$$

Where:
- $f_{\theta_S}$ is the source model with parameters $\theta_S$
- $f_{\theta_T}$ is the target model with parameters $\theta_T$
- $\Omega$ is a regularization term enforcing similarity to source model
- $\lambda$ controls the strength of transfer regularization

### Feature Representation Theory

**Hierarchical Feature Learning**
Deep neural networks learn hierarchical representations where:
- **Lower layers**: Learn generic, transferable features (edges, textures, basic shapes)
- **Higher layers**: Learn task-specific, specialized features (object parts, semantic concepts)

**Mathematical Analysis**:
For a CNN with $L$ layers, the feature representation at layer $l$ is:
$$h^{(l)} = f^{(l)}(h^{(l-1)}; \theta^{(l)})$$

**Transferability Metric**:
The transferability of layer $l$ from source to target task can be measured as:
$$T^{(l)} = \frac{\text{Performance with transferred } h^{(l)}}{\text{Performance with random } h^{(l)}}$$

**Empirical observations show**:
- $T^{(l)}$ decreases with layer depth $l$
- Early layers: $T^{(l)} \gg 1$ (highly transferable)
- Late layers: $T^{(l)} \approx 1$ (less transferable)

**Feature Similarity Analysis**:
Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) measures similarity between feature representations:
$$\text{CKA}(K, L) = \frac{\text{HSIC}(K, L)}{\sqrt{\text{HSIC}(K, K) \text{HSIC}(L, L)}}$$

Where HSIC is Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion:
$$\text{HSIC}(K, L) = \frac{1}{(n-1)^2} \text{tr}(KHLH)$$

## Transfer Learning Taxonomies

### Types of Transfer Learning

**1. Inductive Transfer Learning**
- **Target domain**: Different from source domain
- **Task**: Different but related
- **Labels**: Available in target domain
- **Example**: ImageNet â†’ Medical imaging

**Mathematical Framework**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{inductive} = \mathcal{L}_{target}(D_T, f_{\theta_T}) + \alpha \mathcal{R}(\theta_T, \theta_S)$$

**2. Transductive Transfer Learning**
- **Domain**: Source and target domains different
- **Task**: Same task
- **Labels**: Not available in target domain
- **Example**: Sentiment analysis across different domains

**Mathematical Framework**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{transductive} = \mathcal{L}_{source}(D_S, f_{\theta}) + \beta \mathcal{L}_{domain}(D_S, D_T, f_{\theta})$$

**3. Unsupervised Transfer Learning**
- **Task**: Different but related
- **Labels**: Not available in both domains
- **Example**: Self-supervised representations

### Transfer Learning Strategies

**Feature Extraction (Frozen Features)**
$$f_{target}(x) = g_{\phi}(f_{frozen}(x; \theta_S))$$

Where:
- $f_{frozen}$ is frozen pre-trained feature extractor
- $g_{\phi}$ is trainable classifier with parameters $\phi$
- Only $\phi$ is optimized: $\phi^* = \arg \min_{\phi} \mathcal{L}(D_T, g_{\phi}(f_{frozen}(\cdot)))$

**Fine-Tuning (Adaptive Features)**
$$\theta_T^* = \arg \min_{\theta_T} \mathcal{L}(D_T, f_{\theta_T}) + \lambda ||\theta_T - \theta_S||_2^2$$

The $L_2$ regularization encourages parameters to stay close to pre-trained values.

**Progressive Fine-Tuning**
Gradually unfreeze layers during training:
$$\theta_T^{(t+1)} = \theta_T^{(t)} - \eta \nabla_{\theta_T^{(t)}} \mathcal{L}^{(t)}$$

Where $\mathcal{L}^{(t)}$ includes progressively more layers.

## Fine-Tuning Strategies and Techniques

### Learning Rate Scheduling for Transfer Learning

**Discriminative Learning Rates**
Different layers require different learning rates based on transferability:

$$\eta^{(l)} = \frac{\eta_{base}}{2.6^{(L-l)/\alpha}}$$

Where:
- $L$ is total number of layers
- $l$ is current layer index
- $\alpha$ controls the decay rate

**Cyclical Learning Rates for Fine-Tuning**:
$$\eta(t) = \eta_{min} + \frac{\eta_{max} - \eta_{min}}{2}(1 + \cos(\frac{t}{T}\pi))$$

**Warm-up Strategies**:
$$\eta(t) = \begin{cases}
\eta_{base} \frac{t}{T_{warmup}} & \text{if } t \leq T_{warmup} \\
\eta_{schedule}(t - T_{warmup}) & \text{if } t > T_{warmup}
\end{cases}$$

### Regularization Techniques

**Weight Decay Adaptation**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{task} + \lambda_{wd} \sum_{l=1}^{L} \alpha^{(l)} ||\theta^{(l)}||_2^2$$

Where $\alpha^{(l)}$ is layer-specific weight decay coefficient.

**Knowledge Distillation**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{KD} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{CE}(y, \sigma(z_s/T)) + (1-\alpha) \mathcal{L}_{CE}(y_{hard}, \sigma(z_s))$$

Where:
- $z_s$ are student logits
- $T$ is temperature parameter
- $y$ are soft teacher targets
- $y_{hard}$ are ground truth labels

**Attention Transfer**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{AT} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j} ||\frac{A_S^j}{||A_S^j||_2} - \frac{A_T^j}{||A_T^j||_2}||_2^2$$

Where $A_S^j$ and $A_T^j$ are attention maps from teacher and student at layer $j$.

### Advanced Fine-Tuning Methods

**AdaLN (Adaptive Layer Normalization)**:
$$\text{AdaLN}(h, y) = y_s \frac{h - \mu}{\sigma} + y_b$$

Where $y_s$ and $y_b$ are learned scale and bias parameters conditioned on class information.

**Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)**:
$$\text{FiLM}(F_{i,c}) = \gamma_{i,c} F_{i,c} + \beta_{i,c}$$

Where $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learned affine parameters.

**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**:
$$W = W_0 + \Delta W = W_0 + BA$$

Where:
- $W_0$ is frozen pre-trained weight matrix
- $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$ with $r \ll \min(d,k)$
- Only $A$ and $B$ are trainable

**Mathematical Analysis of LoRA**:
The rank constraint reduces parameters from $dk$ to $r(d+k)$:
$$\text{Compression Ratio} = \frac{dk}{r(d+k)}$$

## Domain Adaptation Theory

### Statistical Learning Theory for Domain Adaptation

**H-divergence Theory**:
For source and target domains with different distributions, the target error is bounded by:

$$\epsilon_T(h) \leq \epsilon_S(h) + \frac{1}{2}d_{\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}}(D_S, D_T) + \lambda$$

Where:
- $\epsilon_S(h)$ is source error
- $d_{\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}}$ is H-divergence between domains
- $\lambda$ is error of ideal joint classifier

**Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN)**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{DANN} = \mathcal{L}_{task}(D_S) - \lambda \mathcal{L}_{domain}(D_S, D_T)$$

**Gradient Reversal Layer**:
During backpropagation:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{domain}}{\partial \theta_f} = -\lambda \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{domain}}{\partial \theta_f}$$

**Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**:
$$\text{MMD}^2(P, Q) = ||\mathbb{E}_{x \sim P}[\phi(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{y \sim Q}[\phi(y)]||_{\mathcal{H}}^2$$

**Deep CORAL**:
Minimize second-order statistics difference:
$$\mathcal{L}_{CORAL} = \frac{1}{4d^2} ||C_S - C_T||_F^2$$

Where $C_S$ and $C_T$ are covariance matrices of source and target features.

### Multi-Source Domain Adaptation

**Weighted Combination**:
$$f_{target} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i f_{source_i}$$

Where weights $w_i$ are learned based on domain similarity:
$$w_i = \frac{\exp(-d(\mathcal{D}_T, \mathcal{D}_{S_i}))}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(-d(\mathcal{D}_T, \mathcal{D}_{S_j}))}$$

**Domain-Specific Batch Normalization**:
$$\text{DSBN}(x, d) = \gamma_d \frac{x - \mu_d}{\sigma_d} + \beta_d$$

Where $d$ indicates domain index.

## Practical Implementation Strategies

### Data Preprocessing for Transfer Learning

**Input Normalization Adaptation**:
When transferring between domains with different statistics:

**Source Statistics**: $\mu_S, \sigma_S$
**Target Statistics**: $\mu_T, \sigma_T$

**Normalization Strategies**:
1. **Keep source normalization**: $x_{norm} = \frac{x - \mu_S}{\sigma_S}$
2. **Adapt to target**: $x_{norm} = \frac{x - \mu_T}{\sigma_T}$
3. **Gradual adaptation**: $x_{norm} = \frac{x - ((1-\alpha)\mu_S + \alpha\mu_T)}{(1-\alpha)\sigma_S + \alpha\sigma_T}$

**Resolution Adaptation**:
For different input resolutions between source and target:

**Bilinear Interpolation**: 
$$I_{new}(x, y) = \sum_{i,j} I_{old}(i, j) K_{bilinear}(x-i, y-j)$$

**Progressive Resizing**:
Start with source resolution and gradually adapt to target resolution during training.

### Architecture Modifications

**Classifier Head Adaptation**:
For different number of classes:

**Standard Linear Layer**:
$$y = Wx + b$$

**Cosine Classifier**:
$$y_i = \frac{W_i^T x}{||W_i|| ||x||} \tau$$

Where $\tau$ is learnable temperature parameter.

**Prototype-based Classification**:
$$p(y=c|x) = \frac{\exp(-d(f(x), p_c))}{\sum_{c'} \exp(-d(f(x), p_{c'}))}$$

Where $p_c$ are class prototypes.

**Multi-Head Architecture**:
For multi-task transfer learning:
$$f(x) = [h_1(g(x)), h_2(g(x)), ..., h_K(g(x))]$$

Where $g$ is shared backbone and $h_k$ are task-specific heads.

### Training Protocols

**Staged Training Protocol**:
1. **Stage 1**: Train classifier head only (frozen backbone)
2. **Stage 2**: Fine-tune top layers with reduced learning rate
3. **Stage 3**: Fine-tune entire network with very small learning rate

**Learning Rate Schedule**:
$$\eta^{(stage)} = \begin{cases}
\eta_0 & \text{Stage 1} \\
\eta_0 / 10 & \text{Stage 2} \\
\eta_0 / 100 & \text{Stage 3}
\end{cases}$$

**Gradual Unfreezing**:
```
Epoch 1-5: Freeze layers 1-7, train layers 8-10
Epoch 6-10: Freeze layers 1-5, train layers 6-10
Epoch 11-15: Freeze layers 1-3, train layers 4-10
Epoch 16-20: Train all layers
```

**Cyclical Fine-tuning**:
Alternate between freezing and unfreezing different parts of the network.

## Few-Shot Learning and Meta-Learning

Where attention mechanism:
$$a(f_{\theta}(x), f_{\theta}(x_i)) = \frac{\exp(c(f_{\theta}(x), f_{\theta}(x_i)))}{\sum_{j=1}^{k} \exp(c(f_{\theta}(x), f_{\theta}(x_j)))}$$
