# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Advanced SQL Agent System employs a sophisticated three-tier memory architecture with specialized agents coordinated through LangGraph workflows.

## Memory Architecture

### Three-Tier Design

1. **Working Memory (Tier 1)**
   - Real-time processing context
   - Agent coordination state
   - Session artifacts

2. **Session Memory (Tier 2)**
   - Conversation history
   - User preferences
   - Context accumulation

3. **Long-term Memory (Tier 3)**
   - Query patterns
   - Schema insights
   - User behavior analytics

## Agent Specialization

### Natural Language Understanding Agent
- Intent extraction
- Entity recognition
- Ambiguity detection

### Schema Intelligence Agent
- Table relevance scoring
- Relationship analysis
- Performance optimization

### SQL Generator Agent
- Template-based generation
- Query optimization
- Alternative generation

### Validation & Security Agent
- Syntax validation
- Security checks
- Performance analysis

### Visualization Agent
- Chart recommendations
- Dashboard creation
- Interactive elements

## Workflow Orchestration

The system uses LangGraph for sophisticated workflow management with:

- Dynamic routing based on confidence scores
- Error recovery and iteration
- Quality assessment loops
- Memory integration at every step

## Data Flow

1. **Query Input** â†’ Natural language processing
2. **Intent Analysis** â†’ Schema identification
3. **SQL Generation** â†’ Validation and security
4. **Execution** â†’ Results processing
5. **Visualization** â†’ Dashboard creation
6. **Memory Update** â†’ Learning integration

## Scalability Considerations

- Asynchronous processing
- Connection pooling
- Intelligent caching
- Resource monitoring

## Security Model

- Query validation
- SQL injection prevention
- Access control
- Audit logging
