## üéØ Advanced Understanding Questions

### Model Compression Theory:
1. **Q**: Analyze the mathematical relationship between model compression ratio and accuracy degradation across different compression techniques (pruning, quantization, distillation).
   **A**: Mathematical relationship varies by technique: pruning follows lottery ticket principle (sparse subnetworks exist), quantization has signal-to-noise ratio bounds (6k+1.76 dB for k-bit), distillation preserves mutual information between teacher and student. Analysis: pruning can achieve high compression with minimal loss for overparameterized networks, quantization trade-off governed by rate-distortion theory, distillation limited by student capacity. Combined approaches: multiplicative compression gains but error accumulation. Key insight: different techniques address different redundancies, combination more effective than individual methods.

2. **Q**: Develop a theoretical framework for knowledge distillation that optimizes the temperature parameter and loss weighting for maximum compression efficiency.
   **A**: Framework based on information theory: optimal temperature œÑ* maximizes mutual information I(Y; f_S(X)) while minimizing I(X; f_S(X)). Analysis: higher temperature preserves more teacher information but may reduce student discriminative power. Optimal weighting: Œ±* balances hard targets (correct classifications) with soft targets (similarity structure). Mathematical formulation: minimize cross-entropy + Œ≤*KL divergence subject to capacity constraints. Key insight: optimal parameters depend on teacher-student capacity ratio and task complexity.

3. **Q**: Compare the theoretical foundations of structured vs unstructured pruning and derive conditions for when each approach is optimal.
   **A**: Theoretical comparison: unstructured pruning allows arbitrary sparsity patterns (higher compression potential), structured pruning maintains regular computation (hardware efficiency). Optimal conditions: unstructured better when hardware supports sparse computation and high compression needed, structured better for standard hardware and real-time constraints. Mathematical analysis: unstructured achieves lower rank approximation errors, structured maintains dense computation patterns. Trade-off: compression ratio vs hardware efficiency. Key insight: optimal choice depends on hardware capabilities and performance requirements.

### Quantization and Efficiency:
4. **Q**: Analyze the mathematical propagation of quantization errors through deep networks and develop strategies for minimizing accuracy degradation.
   **A**: Error propagation analysis: quantization noise accumulates through network layers, with error variance growing approximately linearly with depth. Mathematical model: output error ‚âà Œ£·µ¢ œÉ·µ¢¬≤ where œÉ·µ¢¬≤ is quantization noise at layer i. Mitigation strategies: (1) per-layer quantization levels based on sensitivity, (2) quantization-aware training with gradient approximation, (3) mixed-precision allocation. Optimal strategy: allocate higher precision to sensitive layers (typically first and last). Key insight: quantization error is not uniform across layers, requiring adaptive precision allocation.

5. **Q**: Develop a mathematical theory for hardware-aware quantization that accounts for specific hardware capabilities and constraints.
   **A**: Theory components: (1) hardware cost models for different quantization schemes, (2) performance prediction based on memory hierarchy, (3) energy consumption analysis. Mathematical formulation: minimize inference_time + Œª*energy_consumption subject to accuracy constraints. Hardware considerations: SIMD width affects optimal bit-widths, memory bandwidth influences quantization granularity. Optimal quantization: jointly optimize bit-width and deployment strategy. Key insight: hardware-agnostic quantization suboptimal, need co-design of algorithms and hardware mapping.

6. **Q**: Compare the mathematical efficiency of different neural architecture families (CNNs, Transformers, MobileNets) for mobile deployment scenarios.
   **A**: Efficiency comparison: CNNs have spatial locality (cache-friendly), Transformers have global attention (memory-intensive), MobileNets use separable convolutions (computation-efficient). Mathematical analysis: CNNs O(k¬≤mn) for convolution, Transformers O(n¬≤d) for attention, MobileNets O(k¬≤n + nm) for separable. Mobile deployment: memory bandwidth often limiting factor, favoring architectures with better locality. Key insight: efficiency depends on hardware characteristics, no universally optimal architecture.

### Hardware-Aware Optimization:
7. **Q**: Design a mathematical framework for joint optimization of neural architecture and hardware mapping that minimizes energy consumption while meeting latency constraints.
   **A**: Framework components: (1) architecture search space with efficiency constraints, (2) hardware mapping strategies (tiling, parallelization), (3) energy-latency models. Mathematical formulation: minimize energy(architecture, mapping) subject to latency ‚â§ constraint and accuracy ‚â• threshold. Joint optimization: neural architecture search with hardware cost models, mapping optimization for given architecture. Theoretical guarantee: Pareto optimal solutions on energy-latency frontier. Key insight: architecture and mapping must be co-optimized for optimal efficiency.

8. **Q**: Analyze the fundamental trade-offs between model accuracy, inference latency, energy consumption, and memory usage in mobile computer vision systems.
   **A**: Fundamental trade-offs: accuracy vs efficiency (larger models more accurate but slower), memory vs computation (caching vs recomputation), precision vs energy (higher precision costs more energy). Mathematical analysis: Pareto frontier characterizes optimal trade-offs, no solution dominates all metrics. Multi-objective optimization: weighted sum of objectives or constraint satisfaction. System design: choose operating point based on application requirements. Key insight: mobile deployment requires careful balance of multiple competing objectives with no universal optimal solution.
