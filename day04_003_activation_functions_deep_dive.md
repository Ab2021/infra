# Day 4.3: Activation Functions - Mathematical Foundations and Deep Learning Applications

## Overview
Activation functions serve as the critical nonlinear elements that enable neural networks to approximate arbitrary functions and learn complex patterns. Without activation functions, neural networks would collapse to linear transformations, severely limiting their expressiveness. This comprehensive exploration examines the mathematical properties, theoretical foundations, and practical implications of activation functions in deep learning, from classical sigmoid and tanh functions to modern alternatives like ReLU, attention-based activations, and learnable activation functions.

## Mathematical Role and Theoretical Foundations

### The Necessity of Nonlinearity

**Linear Network Limitations**
Without activation functions, a multi-layer neural network reduces to a single linear transformation:

Consider a two-layer network without activations:
$$h_1 = W_1 x + b_1$$
$$y = W_2 h_1 + b_2 = W_2(W_1 x + b_1) + b_2 = (W_2 W_1)x + (W_2 b_1 + b_2)$$

This is equivalent to a single linear layer: $y = W_{effective} x + b_{effective}$

**Universal Approximation and Nonlinearity**
The universal approximation theorem requires nonlinear activation functions:

For continuous function $f$ on compact set, there exists neural network:
$$g(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \sigma\left(\sum_{j} w_{ij} x_j + b_i\right)$$

Where $\sigma$ is a non-polynomial activation function, such that $|f(x) - g(x)| < \epsilon$.

**Nonlinearity Requirements**:
- **Non-polynomial**: Polynomial activations cannot achieve universal approximation
- **Bounded or Unbounded**: Both types can work but with different properties
- **Differentiable**: Required for gradient-based optimization (though some exceptions exist)
- **Monotonic**: Often preferred but not strictly necessary

### Function Approximation Theory

**Approximation Quality and Activation Choice**
Different activation functions affect approximation quality:

**Smooth vs Non-smooth Functions**:
- **Smooth activations** (sigmoid, tanh): Better for smooth target functions
- **Non-smooth activations** (ReLU): Can approximate non-smooth functions more efficiently
- **Lipschitz Constants**: Activation Lipschitz constant affects network expressivity

**Rate of Approximation**:
For ReLU networks, approximation error decreases as:
$$\mathcal{E}_n \leq C \cdot n^{-2/d}$$

Where:
- $n$: Number of neurons
- $d$: Input dimension  
- $C$: Constant depending on target function

**Depth vs Width Trade-offs with Activations**:
- **ReLU Networks**: Can express functions with exponentially fewer neurons than sigmoid
- **Smooth Activations**: May require exponentially many neurons for certain function classes
- **Compositional Functions**: Deep networks with ReLU excel at hierarchical compositions

## Classical Activation Functions

### Sigmoid Function

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$

**Key Properties**:
- **Range**: $(0, 1)$
- **Monotonic**: Strictly increasing
- **Smooth**: Infinitely differentiable
- **S-shaped**: Characteristic sigmoid curve

**Derivative**:
$$\sigma'(x) = \sigma(x)(1 - \sigma(x))$$

**Probabilistic Interpretation**:
Sigmoid naturally represents probabilities and is the link function in logistic regression:
$$P(y=1|x) = \sigma(w^T x + b)$$

**Historical Significance**:
- **First widely used**: Standard choice in early neural networks
- **Biological inspiration**: Models neuron firing probability
- **Binary classification**: Natural output for binary decisions
- **Gate mechanisms**: Used in LSTM and GRU gates

**Limitations and Problems**:

**Vanishing Gradient Problem**:
$$\max_{x} \sigma'(x) = \sigma'(0) = 0.25$$

Maximum gradient is 0.25, causing gradients to vanish in deep networks:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_1} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a_n} \prod_{i=2}^{n} w_i \sigma'(a_{i-1})$$

**Saturation Regions**:
For $|x| > 4$, $\sigma'(x) \approx 0$, leading to:
- **Dead neurons**: No gradient flow through saturated neurons
- **Slow convergence**: Very slow learning in saturated regions
- **Gradient clipping**: Effective gradients become very small

**Non-zero Centered Outputs**:
Output range $(0,1)$ is not zero-centered:
- **Gradient sign consistency**: All gradients have same sign for weights in a layer
- **Inefficient optimization**: Zigzag pattern in parameter updates
- **Slower convergence**: Less efficient path to optimal parameters

### Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} = \frac{e^{2x} - 1}{e^{2x} + 1}$$

**Relationship to Sigmoid**:
$$\tanh(x) = 2\sigma(2x) - 1$$

**Key Properties**:
- **Range**: $(-1, 1)$
- **Zero-centered**: $\tanh(0) = 0$
- **Antisymmetric**: $\tanh(-x) = -\tanh(x)$
- **Stronger gradients**: $\max_x |\tanh'(x)| = 1$

**Derivative**:
$$\tanh'(x) = 1 - \tanh^2(x)$$

**Advantages over Sigmoid**:
- **Zero-centered output**: Reduces gradient sign consistency problem
- **Stronger gradients**: Maximum gradient of 1 vs 0.25 for sigmoid
- **Symmetric**: Better suited for data with symmetric distributions
- **Less saturation impact**: Less severe saturation issues

**Continued Limitations**:
- **Still saturates**: Vanishing gradient problem persists
- **Computational cost**: More expensive than ReLU
- **Exponential operations**: Requires exponential computations

### ReLU and Variants

**Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**:
$$\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)$$

**Derivative**:
$$\text{ReLU}'(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x > 0 \\
0 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
\text{undefined} & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}$$

**Revolutionary Properties**:

**No Vanishing Gradients** (for positive inputs):
- Gradient is exactly 1 for positive inputs
- No saturation in positive region
- Enables training of very deep networks

**Computational Efficiency**:
- **Simple operation**: Just $\max(0, x)$
- **No exponentials**: No expensive transcendental functions
- **Fast computation**: Trivial forward and backward pass
- **Memory efficient**: Simple comparison operation

**Sparse Activation**:
- **Natural sparsity**: Approximately 50% of neurons inactive
- **Efficient representations**: Only active neurons contribute
- **Biological realism**: Neurons either fire or don't fire

**The Dead ReLU Problem**:
Neurons can become permanently inactive:

**Mechanism**:
- Large negative bias can make $w^T x + b < 0$ always
- Gradient becomes zero for all inputs
- Neuron never updates and remains "dead"

**Causes**:
- **Poor initialization**: Initial bias too negative
- **Large learning rates**: Updates push neurons to negative region
- **Data distribution**: Highly negative input values

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Proper initialization**: He initialization for ReLU networks
- **Learning rate scheduling**: Avoid excessively large learning rates
- **Leaky ReLU**: Allow small gradients for negative inputs

## Modern Activation Functions

### Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU

**Leaky ReLU**:
$$\text{LeakyReLU}(x) = \begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
\alpha x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}$$

Where $\alpha$ is a small fixed constant (typically 0.01).

**Parametric ReLU (PReLU)**:
$$\text{PReLU}(x) = \begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
\alpha_i x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}$$

Where $\alpha_i$ is a learnable parameter for channel $i$.

**Advantages**:
- **No dead neurons**: Negative slope prevents complete deactivation
- **Learnable slope**: PReLU adapts slope based on data
- **Computational efficiency**: Still simple linear operations
- **Improved gradient flow**: Gradients flow through negative region

**ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)**:
$$\text{ELU}(x) = \begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
\alpha(e^x - 1) & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}$$

**Properties**:
- **Smooth**: Differentiable everywhere
- **Negative saturation**: Bounded below by $-\alpha$
- **Zero mean**: Pushes activations closer to zero mean
- **Self-normalizing**: Tends to keep activation statistics stable

**Derivative**:
$$\text{ELU}'(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x > 0 \\
\text{ELU}(x) + \alpha & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}$$

### GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x)$$

Where $\Phi(x)$ is the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function:
$$\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]$$

**Practical Approximation**:
$$\text{GELU}(x) \approx x \cdot \sigma(1.702x)$$

Or the more accurate approximation:
$$\text{GELU}(x) \approx 0.5x\left(1 + \tanh\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\left(x + 0.044715x^3\right)\right)\right)$$

**Theoretical Motivation**:
GELU weights inputs by their percentile in a Gaussian distribution:
- **Stochastic interpretation**: Randomly drop inputs based on their magnitude
- **Smooth**: Unlike ReLU, GELU is smooth everywhere
- **Non-monotonic**: Has a small negative region for small negative inputs

**Properties and Benefits**:
- **Better empirical performance**: Often outperforms ReLU in transformers

- **Transformer standard**: Standard activation in BERT, GPT, and other transformers

### Swish/SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit)

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$\text{Swish}(x) = x \cdot \sigma(x) = \frac{x}{1 + e^{-x}}$$

**Derivative**:
$$\text{Swish}'(x) = \sigma(x) + x \cdot \sigma(x) \cdot (1 - \sigma(x)) = \sigma(x)(1 + x(1 - \sigma(x)))$$

**Properties**:
- **Self-gating**: Input gates itself through sigmoid
- **Smooth**: Infinitely differentiable
- **Non-monotonic**: Slight dip for negative values
- **Unbounded above**: Unlike sigmoid-based functions

**Parametric Swish**:
$$\text{Swish}_\beta(x) = x \cdot \sigma(\beta x)$$

Where $\beta$ can be learned or fixed:
- **$\beta = 1$**: Standard Swish
- **$\beta \to \infty$**: Approaches ReLU
- **$\beta = 0$**: Reduces to $x/2$

**Empirical Benefits**:
- **Better performance**: Often outperforms ReLU on various tasks
- **Smooth optimization**: Smooth derivatives help optimization
- **Self-regularization**: Gating provides implicit regularization

### Mish Activation

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$\text{Mish}(x) = x \cdot \tanh(\ln(1 + e^x)) = x \cdot \tanh(\text{softplus}(x))$$

**Properties**:
- **Smooth**: Infinitely differentiable
- **Self-regularizing**: Bounded below, unbounded above
- **Non-monotonic**: Small negative region for negative inputs
- **Strong gradients**: Better gradient flow than ReLU

**Derivative**:
$$\text{Mish}'(x) = \frac{e^x \omega}{\delta^2}$$

Where:
- $\omega = 4(x + 1) + 4e^{2x} + e^{3x} + e^x(4x + 6)$
- $\delta = 2e^x + e^{2x} + 2$

**Computational Considerations**:
- **More expensive**: Requires exponential and hyperbolic tangent
- **Numerical stability**: Care needed for large inputs
- **Memory overhead**: More complex derivative computation

## Learnable and Adaptive Activation Functions

### Parametric Activations

**PReLU Extended Concept**:
Beyond simple negative slope, parametric activations can learn complex shapes:

**General Parametric Form**:
$$f(x; \theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \theta_i \phi_i(x)$$

Where $\phi_i(x)$ are basis functions and $\theta_i$ are learnable parameters.

**Polynomial Activations**:
$$f(x; \theta) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \theta_i x^i$$

**Rational Activations**:
$$f(x; \theta) = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i}{\sum_{j=0}^{m} b_j x^j}$$

**Advantages**:

### Attention-Based Activations

**Self-Attention Activation**:
$$f(X) = X \odot \text{softmax}(XW_q W_k^T X^T / \sqrt{d})$$

Where $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

**Global Context Activation**:
$$f(x_i) = x_i \cdot \sigma\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} g(x_j)\right)$$

Where $g(\cdot)$ is a learned function that computes context.

**Channel Attention Activation**:
For convolutional layers:
$$f(X) = X \odot \sigma(\text{FC}_2(\text{ReLU}(\text{FC}_1(\text{GAP}(X)))))$$

Where GAP is Global Average Pooling and FC are fully connected layers.
