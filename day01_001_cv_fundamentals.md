## üéØ Key Questions for Self-Assessment

### Beginner Level Questions:
1. **Q**: What are the main differences between classification and detection tasks?

3. **Q**: What is the purpose of feature extraction in the traditional CV pipeline?
   **A**: Feature extraction identifies meaningful patterns, structures, and characteristics from raw image data that can be used for subsequent analysis and decision-making.

### Intermediate Level Questions:
4. **Q**: Explain the difference between semantic and instance segmentation.
   **A**: Semantic segmentation classifies every pixel into predefined categories but doesn't distinguish between different instances of the same class. Instance segmentation identifies individual object instances with pixel-precise boundaries.

5. **Q**: What are the advantages of deep learning approaches over traditional hand-crafted features?
   **A**: Deep learning automatically learns hierarchical feature representations, adapts to data distributions, handles complex patterns, and achieves better performance on large-scale datasets.

8. **Q**: Analyze the trade-offs between different computer vision tasks in terms of computational complexity and accuracy requirements.
   **A**: Classification is computationally lightest but provides limited spatial information. Detection adds localization complexity. Segmentation requires pixel-level predictions, increasing computational and memory requirements but providing precise spatial understanding.
