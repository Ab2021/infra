## PKI Fundamentals and Architecture

### Public Key Infrastructure Overview
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) provides the framework for creating, managing, distributing, using, storing, and revoking digital certificates and managing public-key encryption. PKI is essential for securing AI/ML systems that require strong authentication and encryption across distributed environments.

**Core PKI Components:**
- **Certificate Authority (CA)**: Issues and manages digital certificates
- **Registration Authority (RA)**: Validates certificate requests before issuance
- **Certificate Repository**: Stores and distributes certificates and CRLs
- **Certificate Validation Authority (CVA)**: Provides certificate validation services
- **End Entities**: Users, devices, and applications that use certificates

**PKI Trust Model:**
- Hierarchical trust structure with root CA at the top
- Intermediate CAs extend the hierarchy for operational flexibility
- Cross-certification enables trust between different PKI domains
- Bridge CAs facilitate trust relationships between multiple hierarchies

**Security Services Provided:**
- **Authentication**: Verify identity of communicating parties
- **Confidentiality**: Encrypt data using public key cryptography
- **Integrity**: Detect tampering through digital signatures
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevent denial of digital transactions

### X.509 Certificate Standards
X.509 defines the standard format for public key certificates, providing a consistent structure for certificate information across different systems and applications.

**Certificate Structure Components:**
- **Version**: X.509 version (v1, v2, v3)
- **Serial Number**: Unique identifier within the issuing CA
- **Signature Algorithm**: Algorithm used by CA to sign the certificate
- **Issuer**: Distinguished Name (DN) of the Certificate Authority
- **Validity Period**: Not Before and Not After dates
- **Subject**: Distinguished Name of the certificate holder
- **Subject Public Key Info**: Public key and algorithm parameters
- **Extensions**: Additional attributes and constraints (v3 only)

**Distinguished Name (DN) Components:**
- **Country (C)**: Two-letter country code
- **Organization (O)**: Organization name
- **Organizational Unit (OU)**: Department or division
- **Common Name (CN)**: Individual name or FQDN for servers
- **Locality (L)**: City or locality name
- **State/Province (ST)**: State or province name
- **Email Address**: Email address of certificate holder

**Critical Certificate Extensions:**
- **Subject Alternative Name (SAN)**: Additional identities for the certificate
- **Key Usage**: Specifies allowed uses for the public key
- **Extended Key Usage (EKU)**: Additional constraints on key usage

- **Authority Key Identifier**: Links to the issuing CA's certificate
- **Subject Key Identifier**: Unique identifier for the subject's public key

### Trust Models and Hierarchies
**Hierarchical Trust Model:**
