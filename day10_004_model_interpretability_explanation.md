# Day 10.4: Model Interpretability and Explanation - Theoretical Foundations and Methodologies

## Overview

Model interpretability and explanation represent fundamental requirements for building trustworthy, accountable, and deployable machine learning systems, encompassing sophisticated mathematical frameworks and computational techniques that reveal how models make decisions, which features drive predictions, and what patterns have been learned from data. This comprehensive domain combines insights from game theory, information theory, optimization theory, and cognitive science to provide principled approaches for understanding complex models ranging from linear classifiers to deep neural networks. The theoretical foundations enable both global understanding of model behavior across entire datasets and local explanations for individual predictions, supporting applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal systems where model transparency is not just beneficial but often legally mandated.

## Theoretical Foundations of Interpretability

### Definitions and Taxonomy

**Interpretability vs Explainability**
- **Interpretability**: The degree to which humans can understand the cause of a decision
- **Explainability**: The ability to explain or present in understandable terms to humans

**Mathematical Framework for Interpretability**
Let $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ be a model and $g: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}$ be an explanation function.

**Fidelity**: How well explanation matches model:
$$\text{Fidelity}(f, g) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim P(X)}[\mathbf{1}[f(x) = g(x)]]$$

**Comprehensibility**: Human understanding measure:
$$\text{Comp}(g) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{H}|} \sum_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \text{Understanding}(h, g)$$

Where $\mathcal{H}$ is set of human evaluators.

### Taxonomy of Interpretability Methods

**Global vs Local Interpretability**
- **Global**: Understanding entire model behavior
- **Local**: Understanding specific prediction

**Model-Agnostic vs Model-Specific**
- **Model-Agnostic**: Works with any model type
- **Model-Specific**: Designed for particular architectures

**Post-Hoc vs Ante-Hoc**
- **Post-Hoc**: Applied after model training
- **Ante-Hoc**: Built into model architecture

### Information-Theoretic Foundations

**Mutual Information for Feature Importance**
$$I(X_i; Y) = \sum_{x_i, y} p(x_i, y) \log \frac{p(x_i, y)}{p(x_i)p(y)}$$

**Conditional Importance**
$$I(X_i; Y | X_{-i}) = H(Y | X_{-i}) - H(Y | X)$$

**Shapley Information**
Extension of Shapley values to information theory:
$$\phi_i = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} [I(Y; X_S \cup \{i\}) - I(Y; X_S)]$$

### Game-Theoretic Framework

**Cooperative Game for Attribution**
Players: Features $N = \{1, 2, ..., p\}$
Characteristic function: $v(S) = \text{Model performance with features } S$

**Shapley Value Properties**
1. **Efficiency**: $\sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i = v(N) - v(\emptyset)$
2. **Symmetry**: If $i$ and $j$ contribute equally, $\phi_i = \phi_j$
3. **Dummy**: If feature $i$ doesn't contribute, $\phi_i = 0$
4. **Additivity**: $\phi_i[v + w] = \phi_i[v] + \phi_i[w]$

## Global Interpretability Methods

### Feature Importance Analysis

**Permutation Importance**
Measure importance by performance drop when feature is permuted:
$$\text{FI}_j = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} [S(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}) - S(\mathbf{X}_{\pi_j}, \mathbf{y})]$$

Where $\mathbf{X}_{\pi_j}$ has feature $j$ permuted.

**Theoretical Properties**:
- **Unbiased**: $\mathbb{E}[\text{FI}_j] = \text{True importance}$
- **Consistent**: Converges to true value as $B \rightarrow \infty$
- **Model-agnostic**: Works with any model type

**Drop-Column Importance**
$$\text{DCI}_j = S(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}) - S(\mathbf{X}_{-j}, \mathbf{y})$$

**Variance Decomposition**
$$\text{Var}[Y] = \sum_i V_i + \sum_{i<j} V_{ij} + ... + V_{12...p}$$

Where $V_i = \text{Var}[\mathbb{E}[Y|X_i]]$ (main effect)
and $V_{ij} = \text{Var}[\mathbb{E}[Y|X_i, X_j]] - V_i - V_j$ (interaction)

### Partial Dependence Analysis

**Partial Dependence Function**
$$\text{PD}_S(x_S) = \mathbb{E}_{X_C}[f(x_S, X_C)]$$

Where $S$ is subset of features and $C$ is complement.

**Estimation**:
$$\widehat{\text{PD}}_S(x_S) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_S, x_C^{(i)})$$

**Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE)**
$$\text{ICE}_i(x_S) = f(x_S, x_C^{(i)})$$

**Centered ICE**:
$$\text{c-ICE}_i(x_S) = f(x_S, x_C^{(i)}) - \frac{1}{|X_S|} \sum_{k} f(x_S^{(k)}, x_C^{(i)})$$

**Derivative-Based Importance**
$$\text{PD-Importance}_j = \int \left|\frac{\partial \text{PD}_j(x_j)}{\partial x_j}\right| p(x_j) dx_j$$

### Accumulated Local Effects (ALE)

**ALE Addresses PD Limitations**
When features are correlated, PD can be misleading by extrapolating to unrealistic feature combinations.

**ALE Definition**
$$\text{ALE}_j(x_j) = \int_{z_{j,min}}^{x_j} \mathbb{E}_{X_C | X_j = z_j}\left[\frac{\partial f(X_j, X_C)}{\partial X_j} \bigg|_{X_j = z_j}\right] dz_j - \text{constant}$$

**First-Order ALE Estimation**
For interval $[z_{k,j}, z_{k+1,j}]$:
$$\widehat{\text{ALE}}_j(x_j) = \sum_{k=1}^{k_j(x_j)} \frac{1}{n_j(k)} \sum_{i: x_j^{(i)} \in N_j(k)} [f(z_{k+1,j}, x_C^{(i)}) - f(z_{k,j}, x_C^{(i)})]$$

**Second-Order ALE**
For feature interactions:
$$\text{ALE}_{j,k}(x_j, x_k) = \int_{z_{j,min}}^{x_j} \int_{z_{k,min}}^{x_k} \mathbb{E}_{X_C | X_j, X_k}\left[\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X_j \partial X_k}\right] dz_k dz_j$$

### Global Surrogate Models

**Surrogate Model Training**
Train interpretable model $g$ to approximate $f$:
$$g^* = \arg\min_g \mathbb{E}_{X}[(f(X) - g(X))^2] + \lambda \Omega(g)$$

Where $\Omega(g)$ is complexity penalty.

**Fidelity Metrics**
$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_i (f(x_i) - g(x_i))^2}{\sum_i (f(x_i) - \bar{f})^2}$$

**Decision Tree Surrogate**
$$g(x) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} c_m \mathbf{1}[x \in R_m]$$

**Linear Surrogate**
$$g(x) = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j x_j$$

## Local Interpretability Methods

### LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)

**Mathematical Formulation**
Find explanation $g$ that minimizes:
$$\xi(x) = \arg\min_{g \in G} \mathcal{L}(f, g, \pi_x) + \Omega(g)$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{L}(f, g, \pi_x)$ is local fidelity loss
- $\pi_x$ is proximity measure to instance $x$
- $\Omega(g)$ is complexity penalty

**Proximity-Weighted Loss**
$$\mathcal{L}(f, g, \pi_x) = \sum_{z \in Z} \pi_x(z) [f(z) - g(z)]^2$$

**Sampling Strategy**
Generate perturbed samples $z'$ around $x$:
$$z'_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(0.5) \text{ for binary features}$$
$$z'_i \sim \mathcal{N}(x_i, \sigma^2) \text{ for continuous features}$$

**Feature Selection in LIME**
Use forward selection with K-LASSO:
$$\arg\min_{\beta, |supp(\beta)| \leq K} \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y_i - x_i^T \beta)^2$$

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

**Unified Framework**
SHAP provides unified framework satisfying:
$$f(x) = \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{M} \phi_i$$

**SHAP Values as Shapley Values**
$$\phi_i(f, x) = \sum_{S \subseteq \mathcal{F} \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|\mathcal{F}| - |S| - 1)!}{|\mathcal{F}|!} [f_x(S \cup \{i\}) - f_x(S)]$$

**Expected Value Definition**
$$\phi_i = \mathbb{E}[f(x) | do(X_i = x_i)] - \mathbb{E}[f(x)]$$

### SHAP Variants

**TreeSHAP**
For tree-based models, compute SHAP values exactly:
$$\phi_i = \sum_{S \subseteq \mathcal{F} \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|\mathcal{F}| - |S| - 1)!}{|\mathcal{F}|!} [f_x(S \cup \{i\}) - f_x(S)]$$

**Polynomial Time Algorithm**: $O(TLD^2)$ where:
- $T$ is number of trees
- $L$ is maximum number of leaves
- $D$ is maximum depth

**DeepSHAP**
For neural networks, backpropagate SHAP values:
$$\phi_i^{(l)} = \sum_{j \in \text{children}(i)} \phi_j^{(l+1)} \times \text{multiplier}_{i \rightarrow j}$$

**KernelSHAP**
Model-agnostic approach using weighted linear regression:
$$\min_{\phi} \sum_{z \in Z} \pi(z) [f(z) - \phi_0 - \sum_{i=1}^{M} z_i \phi_i]^2$$

With weights: $\pi(z) = \frac{M-1}{\binom{M}{|z|} |z| (M - |z|)}$

**Linear SHAP**
For linear models: $\phi_i = (x_i - \mathbb{E}[X_i]) \beta_i$

**Gradient SHAP**
$$\phi_i = (x_i - x_i') \int_{\alpha=0}^{1} \frac{\partial f(x' + \alpha(x - x'))}{\partial x_i} d\alpha$$

### Counterfactual Explanations

**Counterfactual Definition**
Find minimal change to input that changes prediction:
$$x_{cf} = \arg\min_{x'} d(x, x') \text{ s.t. } f(x') \neq f(x)$$

**Distance Metrics**
**Manhattan Distance**: $d_1(x, x') = \sum_i |x_i - x'_i|$
**Euclidean Distance**: $d_2(x, x') = \sqrt{\sum_i (x_i - x'_i)^2}$
**Gower Distance**: For mixed data types

**Multi-Objective Optimization**
$$\min_{x'} [d(x, x'), \mathcal{L}(f(x'), y_{target}), \text{diversity}(x')]$$

**Gradient-Based Generation**
$$x' = x - \alpha \nabla_x [\lambda_1 \mathcal{L}(f(x), y_{target}) + \lambda_2 d(x, x)]$$

**Plausibility Constraints**
Ensure counterfactuals lie on data manifold:
$$\min_{x'} d(x, x') \text{ s.t. } x' \in \text{Manifold}(\mathcal{X})$$

### Anchors

**Anchor Definition**
Find minimal sufficient conditions for prediction:
$$A \text{ is an anchor if } \mathbb{P}(f(x) = f(z) | z_A = x_A) \geq \tau$$

**Beam Search Algorithm**
1. Start with empty anchor
2. Iteratively add features that maximize coverage
3. Stop when precision $\geq \tau$

**Multi-Armed Bandit Formulation**
Each candidate anchor is an arm:
$$\text{UCB}_t(a) = \hat{\mu}_t(a) + \sqrt{\frac{2\log t}{n_t(a)}}$$

Where $\hat{\mu}_t(a)$ is estimated precision of anchor $a$.

## Model-Specific Interpretability

### Linear Models

**Coefficient Interpretation**
For linear regression: $y = \beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j$
- $\beta_j$ represents change in $y$ per unit change in $x_j$

**Standardized Coefficients**
$$\beta_j^* = \beta_j \frac{\sigma_{X_j}}{\sigma_Y}$$

**Statistical Significance**
$$t_j = \frac{\hat{\beta}_j}{SE(\hat{\beta}_j)}$$

**Confidence Intervals**
$$CI_j = \hat{\beta}_j \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-p-1} \times SE(\hat{\beta}_j)$$

### Tree-Based Models

**Feature Importance in Trees**
$$\text{FI}_j = \sum_{t \in \text{Tree}} p(t) \Delta_t \mathbf{1}[\text{split variable}(t) = j]$$

Where $\Delta_t$ is impurity decrease at node $t$.

**Split Point Analysis**
For feature $j$: Distribution of split points $\{s_{j,1}, s_{j,2}, ...\}$

**Path-Based Explanations**
For prediction path $P = \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_k\}$:
$$\text{Explanation} = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{k-1} \text{condition}(t_i)$$

### Neural Networks

**Gradient-Based Attribution**
**Saliency Maps**: $\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_i}$

**Integrated Gradients**
$$IG_i(x) = (x_i - x_i') \int_{\alpha=0}^{1} \frac{\partial f(x' + \alpha(x - x'))}{\partial x_i} d\alpha$$

**Properties**:
- **Sensitivity**: Non-zero gradient for important features
- **Implementation Invariance**: Same attribution for functionally identical networks

**Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)**
Backward propagation of relevance scores:
$$R_i^{(l)} = \sum_j \frac{a_i^{(l)} w_{ij}^{(l,l+1)}}{\sum_k a_k^{(l)} w_{kj}^{(l,l+1)}} R_j^{(l+1)}$$

**GradCAM**
For CNNs, combine gradients and activations:
$$L_{Grad-CAM}^c = \text{ReLU}\left(\sum_k \alpha_k^c A^k\right)$$

Where $\alpha_k^c = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_i \sum_j \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{ij}^k}$

**Attention Visualization**
For attention mechanisms:
$$\text{Attention}_{i,j} = \frac{\exp(e_{i,j})}{\sum_{k=1}^{T_x} \exp(e_{i,k})}$$

## Advanced Interpretability Techniques

### Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV)

**Concept Definition**
Learn linear classifier to distinguish concept:
$$v_{C,l} = \text{direction in activation space at layer } l$$

**TCAV Score**
$$\text{TCAV}_{Q,C,l}(x) = \frac{\nabla h_{l,Q}(f_l(x)) \cdot v_{C,l}}{||\nabla h_{l,Q}(f_l(x))|||}$$

**Statistical Testing**
Test if concept is significantly important:
$$H_0: \text{TCAV scores are random}$$

### Influence Functions

**Influence of Training Point**
$$\mathcal{I}_{up,params}(z, z_{test}) = -\nabla_{\theta} L(z_{test}, \hat{\theta}) H_{\hat{\theta}}^{-1} \nabla_{\theta} L(z, \hat{\theta})$$

Where $H_{\hat{\theta}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \nabla^2_{\theta} L(z_i, \hat{\theta})$ is Hessian.

**Influence on Loss**
$$\mathcal{I}_{up,loss}(z, z_{test}) = -\nabla_{\theta} L(z_{test}, \hat{\theta})^T H_{\hat{\theta}}^{-1} \nabla_{\theta} L(z, \hat{\theta})$$

**Approximation for Large Models**
Use Conjugate Gradient: $H_{\hat{\theta}}^{-1} v \approx s$ where $H_{\hat{\theta}} s = v$

### Prototype-Based Explanations

**Prototype Selection**
Find representative examples for each class:
$$P_k = \arg\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}_k} \sum_{x' \in \mathcal{X}_k} d(x, x')$$

**Criticisms**
Find examples that are poorly explained by prototypes:
$$C_k = \arg\max_{x \in \mathcal{X}_k} \min_{p \in P_k} d(x, p)$$

**MMD-Critic Algorithm**
Minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy:
$$\text{MMD}^2(\mathcal{X}, P) = ||\mu_{\mathcal{X}} - \mu_P||_{\mathcal{H}}^2$$

## Evaluation of Explanations

$$\text{Pareto Frontier}: \{\text{models where improving one requires sacrificing other}\}$$

**Completeness vs Comprehensibility**
Complete explanations may be too complex for human understanding.

**Fidelity vs Simplicity**

Post-hoc selection of favorable explanations:
$$P(\text{selecting explanation} | \text{explanation supports desired narrative})$$

**Disagreement Between Methods**
Different explanation methods can give conflicting results:
$$\text{Correlation}(\text{Method}_A, \text{Method}_B) < \tau$$

### Cognitive and Social Limitations

**Confirmation Bias**
Humans tend to accept explanations that confirm expectations:
$$P(\text{accept explanation} | \text{confirms prior belief}) > P(\text{accept} | \text{contradicts prior})$$

**Illusion of Understanding**
Explanations may create false confidence:
$$\text{Perceived Understanding} > \text{Actual Understanding}$$

**Explanation Satisficing**
Humans may stop at first plausible explanation rather than seeking truth.
