# Day 19.3: Advanced GAN Variants & Applications - A Practical Guide

## Introduction: Beyond Simple Image Generation

The original GAN and DCGAN architectures were revolutionary, but they had limitations. They could generate images, but the user had little to no control over *what* was generated. The output was random. Subsequent research has focused on creating advanced GAN variants that offer more control, produce higher-resolution images, and can be applied to a wider range of tasks beyond simple generation.

This guide provides a practical overview of several of the most important and influential advanced GAN architectures and their applications.

**Today's Learning Objectives:**

1.  **Understand Conditional GANs (cGAN):** Learn how to control the GAN's output by providing it with a conditional input, like a class label.
2.  **Explore Image-to-Image Translation (Pix2Pix):** See how a cGAN can be used to translate one type of image into another (e.g., satellite maps to street maps).
3.  **Learn about Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CycleGAN):** Understand the concept of cycle consistency loss, which allows for training translation models without paired data.
4.  **Grasp High-Resolution Generation (StyleGAN):** Get a high-level understanding of the progressive growing and style-based techniques used by StyleGAN to generate stunningly photorealistic faces.

## Part 1: Conditional GAN (cGAN) - Adding Control

**The Idea:** A standard GAN generates a random image from a noise vector `z`. A **Conditional GAN (cGAN)** allows us to control the generation by providing both the generator and the discriminator with an additional piece of information, `y`, which is typically a class label.

**How it Works:**
*   **Generator:** The generator's input is now the concatenation of the noise vector `z` and the conditional vector `y` (e.g., a one-hot encoded class label). It learns to generate an image that corresponds to that class. `G(z, y)`.
*   **Discriminator:** The discriminator's input is a pair: the image `x` and the conditional vector `y`. It learns to determine if `x` is a real image belonging to class `y` or a fake image generated for class `y`. `D(x, y)`.

**The Result:** You can now ask the generator to produce an image of a specific class. For example, if trained on MNIST, you can ask it to generate a "7" or a "3".

print("--- Part 1: Conditional GAN (cGAN) ---")

# --- Parameters ---
latent_dim = 100
num_classes = 10
image_dim = 784 # Flattened MNIST

# --- cGAN Generator ---
class cGenerator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(cGenerator, self).__init__()
        # We need an embedding layer for the class label
        self.label_emb = nn.Embedding(num_classes, num_classes)
        # The input to the generator is now noise + label embedding
        self.main = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(latent_dim + num_classes, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, image_dim),
            nn.Tanh()
        )
    def forward(self, z, labels):
        c = self.label_emb(labels)
        x = torch.cat([z, c], 1)
        return self.main(x)

# --- cGAN Discriminator ---
class cDiscriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(cDiscriminator, self).__init__()
        self.label_emb = nn.Embedding(num_classes, num_classes)
        # The input is now the image + the label embedding
        self.main = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(image_dim + num_classes, 128),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.Linear(128, 1)
        )
    def forward(self, img, labels):
        c = self.label_emb(labels)
        x = torch.cat([img, c], 1)
        return self.main(x)

print("cGAN adds a conditional input `y` to both G and D to control generation.")
```

## Part 2: Image-to-Image Translation

This family of models uses a GAN framework to learn a mapping from one image domain to another.

### 2.1. Pix2Pix: Paired Image-to-Image Translation

*   **The Task:** Translate an image from a source domain A to a target domain B, where you have **paired** training data (i.e., for every image in A, you have its exact corresponding image in B).
    *   *Examples:* satellite maps -> street maps, black & white photos -> color photos, edges -> photos.
*   **The Architecture:** It uses a cGAN framework.
    *   **Generator:** A **U-Net** architecture. The U-Net's encoder-decoder structure with skip connections is very effective at tasks where there is a high degree of spatial correspondence between the input and output.
    *   **Discriminator:** A special **PatchGAN** discriminator. Instead of classifying the entire output image as real or fake, the PatchGAN looks at small `N x N` patches of the image and classifies each patch as real or fake. It then averages the results. This encourages the generator to produce realistic high-frequency details.

### 2.2. CycleGAN: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation

*   **The Problem:** What if you don't have paired data? For example, you have a collection of horse photos and a collection of zebra photos, but no pictures of a specific horse and that same horse transformed into a zebra.
*   **The Solution: Cycle Consistency Loss**
    *   CycleGAN uses two Generators (G_AtoB and G_BtoA) and two Discriminators (D_A and D_B).
    *   It trains them with a standard adversarial loss.
    *   The key innovation is the **cycle consistency loss**. If you take an image from domain A, translate it to domain B (`fake_B = G_AtoB(real_A)`), and then translate it *back* to domain A (`reconstructed_A = G_BtoA(fake_B)`), the reconstructed image should look identical to the original image. 
    *   `Loss_cycle = || real_A - reconstructed_A ||`
*   **Why it Works:** This loss forces the generators to learn a meaningful mapping between the domains, rather than just producing a plausible image in the target domain that has nothing to do with the input.

## Part 3: High-Resolution Generation - StyleGAN

**The Task:** Generate extremely high-resolution, photorealistic images, particularly human faces.

**The Architecture (StyleGAN & StyleGAN2):** StyleGAN, developed by NVIDIA, introduced several key innovations to achieve unprecedented realism.

1.  **Progressive Growing:** (From an earlier paper, ProGAN). The model is trained progressively. It starts by generating very small images (e.g., 4x4), and as training stabilizes, new layers are added to both the generator and discriminator to increase the output resolution (8x8, 16x16, ..., 1024x1024). This makes training much more stable.

2.  **Style-based Generator:** This is the core idea of StyleGAN. 
    *   Instead of feeding the noise vector `z` directly to the generator, it is first passed through a **mapping network** (a simple MLP) to produce an intermediate latent vector `w`.
    *   This `w` vector is then used to control the **style** (via a mechanism called Adaptive Instance Normalization or AdaIN) of the generator's output at each resolution level.

**Why it Works:**
*   **Disentanglement:** The intermediate latent space `W` is more disentangled than the input noise space `Z`. This means different dimensions of `w` tend to control different high-level attributes of the face (e.g., hair color, age, pose).
*   **Hierarchical Control:** Injecting the style at different layers allows for coarse-to-fine control. Styles injected at early layers control coarse features like pose and face shape, while styles injected at later layers control fine details like hair texture and lighting.

**The Result:** The ability to generate stunningly realistic faces and to control their attributes by manipulating the `w` vector.

## Conclusion: The Expanding Universe of GANs

GANs are one of the most creative and rapidly evolving areas of deep learning. From their simple adversarial beginnings, they have been extended and adapted to solve a huge range of problems far beyond just generating random images.

**Key Takeaways:**

1.  **Control with Conditions:** Conditional GANs (cGANs) are the fundamental way to gain control over the generative process by providing an additional input `y`.
2.  **Translate with Paired Data (Pix2Pix):** For paired image-to-image translation, a U-Net generator and a PatchGAN discriminator are a powerful combination.
3.  **Translate with Unpaired Data (CycleGAN):** For unpaired data, the addition of a cycle consistency loss is the key to learning a meaningful mapping.
4.  **Achieve Realism with Style (StyleGAN):** For state-of-the-art, high-resolution generation, StyleGAN's architecture with its mapping network and style-based control is the gold standard.

These advanced variants demonstrate the flexibility of the adversarial framework and have pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible with generative models.
