## Privacy-Preserving Robust Training

### Differential Privacy in Adversarial Training

**DP-SGD for Robust Models:**

Differential privacy in adversarial training requires careful integration of privacy protection mechanisms with robustness training procedures while ensuring that privacy protection does not undermine adversarial robustness and that robustness training does not compromise privacy guarantees.

Noise calibration for DP-SGD in adversarial training must account for the increased gradient norms typical in adversarial training while maintaining appropriate privacy guarantees. The interaction between adversarial examples and differential privacy noise requires careful analysis to ensure that privacy budgets are appropriately allocated and that noise levels provide meaningful privacy protection.

Privacy accounting for adversarial training must track privacy expenditure across both clean and adversarial examples while accounting for the different gradient characteristics and computational patterns typical in robust training procedures. Advanced accounting methods may be required to provide tight privacy bounds that enable practical deployment.

Utility preservation in private adversarial training requires techniques that minimize the impact of differential privacy noise on adversarial robustness while maintaining both privacy guarantees and robustness effectiveness under realistic privacy budgets.

**Federated Adversarial Training:**

Federated adversarial training combines the distributed training benefits of federated learning with the robustness benefits of adversarial training while addressing the unique challenges that arise from combining these two approaches in privacy-sensitive environments.
