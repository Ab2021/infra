## 1. Foundations of Sequential Recommendation

### 1.1 The Temporal Dimension in User Behavior

**Beyond Static Preferences**

Traditional recommendation systems often treat user preferences as static, but real-world user behavior is inherently sequential and temporal:

**Temporal Characteristics of User Behavior**
- **Evolution of Interests**: User preferences change over time due to life events, trends, and personal growth
- **Contextual Variations**: Preferences vary based on time of day, season, location, and current activities
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Current actions are influenced by previous actions and experiences
- **Habit Formation**: Users develop patterns and habits that influence future behavior

**Types of Temporal Patterns**

**Short-term Patterns (Session-level)**
- **Intent Coherence**: Actions within a session often share common intent
- **Task Completion**: Users work toward specific goals within sessions
- **Browsing Patterns**: Systematic exploration and comparison behaviors
- **Immediate Context**: Current mood, time constraints, and situational factors

**Medium-term Patterns (Days to Weeks)**
- **Routine Behaviors**: Daily and weekly patterns in user activities
- **Seasonal Interests**: Recurring seasonal preferences and behaviors
