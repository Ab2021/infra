# Day 4.4: Loss Functions - Mathematical Foundations and Learning Objectives

## Overview
Loss functions serve as the mathematical bridge between neural network predictions and learning objectives, defining what it means for a model to perform well on a given task. They quantify the discrepancy between predicted and target outputs, providing the gradient signal that drives the learning process through backpropagation. This comprehensive exploration examines the theoretical foundations, mathematical properties, and practical applications of loss functions across different learning paradigms, from basic regression and classification to advanced techniques in deep learning.

## Mathematical Foundations and Optimization Theory

### Loss Functions in the Context of Empirical Risk Minimization

**Empirical Risk Minimization Framework**
Loss functions formalize the learning problem within the empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework:

$$\hat{f} = \arg\min_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ell(f(x_i), y_i) + \lambda R(f)$$

Where:
- $\ell(\cdot, \cdot)$: Loss function measuring prediction quality
- $f(x_i)$: Model prediction for input $x_i$
- $y_i$: True target for input $x_i$
- $R(f)$: Regularization term
- $\lambda$: Regularization strength
- $\mathcal{F}$: Hypothesis class (e.g., neural networks)

**Population Risk vs Empirical Risk**:
- **Population Risk**: $R(f) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \mathcal{D}}[\ell(f(x), y)]$
- **Empirical Risk**: $\hat{R}(f) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ell(f(x_i), y_i)$
- **Generalization Gap**: $|R(f) - \hat{R}(f)|$

**Consistency and Convergence**:
A loss function is consistent for a learning problem if:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \hat{R}(f_n) = R^*$$

Where $R^*$ is the minimum possible risk (Bayes risk).

### Properties of Good Loss Functions

**Mathematical Desiderata**:

**Convexity**:
A loss function $\ell(f(x), y)$ is convex in $f(x)$ if:
$$\ell(\lambda f_1(x) + (1-\lambda) f_2(x), y) \leq \lambda \ell(f_1(x), y) + (1-\lambda) \ell(f_2(x), y)$$

**Benefits of Convexity**:
- **Global optima**: Any local minimum is a global minimum
- **Optimization guarantees**: Convergence to optimal solution
- **Efficient algorithms**: Many efficient convex optimization algorithms exist

**Smoothness and Differentiability**:
- **Gradient existence**: Enables gradient-based optimization
- **Lipschitz continuity**: Bounds gradient magnitude for stability
- **Second-order differentiability**: Enables second-order optimization methods

**Proper Scoring Rules**:
A loss function is a proper scoring rule if:
$$\mathbb{E}[\ell(p, Y)] \leq \mathbb{E}[\ell(q, Y)]$$

For any $q$ when $p$ is the true distribution, encouraging honest predictions.

**Fisher Consistency**:
A loss function is Fisher consistent if minimizing expected loss yields the optimal classifier:
$$f^* = \arg\min_f \mathbb{E}[\ell(f(X), Y)] \text{ implies } f^* = f_{\text{Bayes}}$$

### Information Theory and Loss Functions

**Connection to Maximum Likelihood**:
Many loss functions derive from maximum likelihood estimation:

$$\hat{\theta} = \arg\max_\theta \prod_{i=1}^{n} p(y_i | x_i; \theta)$$

Taking negative log-likelihood:
$$\hat{\theta} = \arg\min_\theta -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log p(y_i | x_i; \theta)$$

**Cross-Entropy and KL Divergence**:
Cross-entropy loss corresponds to minimizing KL divergence:
$$D_{KL}(p||q) = \sum_i p_i \log\frac{p_i}{q_i} = H(p,q) - H(p)$$

Since $H(p)$ is constant, minimizing cross-entropy $H(p,q)$ minimizes KL divergence.

**Mutual Information Perspective**:
Some loss functions can be viewed as maximizing mutual information:
$$I(X; Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$$

Encouraging predictions that reduce uncertainty about targets.

## Regression Loss Functions

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$\text{MSE}(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

**Probabilistic Interpretation**:
MSE corresponds to maximum likelihood estimation under Gaussian noise:
$$p(y|x, \sigma^2) = \mathcal{N}(f(x), \sigma^2)$$

**Properties and Characteristics**:
- **Convex**: Unique global minimum
- **Differentiable**: Smooth gradients everywhere
- **Unbounded**: Penalties grow quadratically with error
- **Outlier sensitive**: Large errors heavily penalized

**Gradient Analysis**:
$$\frac{\partial \text{MSE}}{\partial \hat{y}_i} = -2(y_i - \hat{y}_i)$$

Gradients scale linearly with error magnitude.

**Statistical Properties**:
- **Unbiased**: $\mathbb{E}[\hat{y}] = y$ minimizes MSE
- **Variance decomposition**: $\text{MSE} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Noise}$
- **L2 regularization**: Corresponds to Gaussian prior on parameters

**When to Use MSE**:
- **Gaussian targets**: Natural choice for Gaussian-distributed targets
- **Outlier-free data**: When extreme values are truly erroneous
- **Smooth optimization**: When smooth loss surface is desired
- **Interpretability**: Easy to understand and interpret

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$\text{MAE}(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$$

**Probabilistic Interpretation**:
MAE corresponds to maximum likelihood under Laplace distribution:
$$p(y|x, b) = \frac{1}{2b} \exp\left(-\frac{|y - f(x)|}{b}\right)$$

**Properties and Characteristics**:
- **Convex**: But not strictly convex
- **Robust**: Less sensitive to outliers than MSE
- **Non-differentiable**: At zero error point
- **Constant gradients**: $\pm 1$ regardless of error magnitude

**Gradient Analysis**:
$$\frac{\partial \text{MAE}}{\partial \hat{y}_i} = \text{sign}(\hat{y}_i - y_i)$$

**Robustness Properties**:
- **Breakdown point**: 50% (can handle up to 50% outliers)
- **Bounded influence**: Outliers have limited impact on loss
- **Median regression**: Minimizing MAE yields conditional median

**Optimization Challenges**:
- **Non-smooth**: Requires subgradient methods or smoothing
- **Slow convergence**: Near optimal solution convergence is slow
- **Gradient switching**: Gradient sign changes at exact solution

### Huber Loss

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$L_\delta(y, \hat{y}) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}(y - \hat{y})^2 & \text{if } |y - \hat{y}| \leq \delta \\
\delta |y - \hat{y}| - \frac{1}{2}\delta^2 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Hybrid Properties**:
- **Small errors**: Quadratic like MSE (smooth gradients)
- **Large errors**: Linear like MAE (robust to outliers)
- **Tunable**: Parameter $\delta$ controls transition point

**Gradient Analysis**:
$$\frac{\partial L_\delta}{\partial \hat{y}} = \begin{cases}
-(y - \hat{y}) & \text{if } |y - \hat{y}| \leq \delta \\
-\delta \cdot \text{sign}(y - \hat{y}) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Benefits**:
- **Best of both worlds**: Smooth optimization + outlier robustness
- **Differentiable**: Except at boundary points
- **Tunable robustness**: Can adjust sensitivity to outliers

**Parameter Selection**:
- **Small $\delta$**: More robust, less smooth
- **Large $\delta$**: More smooth, less robust
- **Adaptive $\delta$**: Learn optimal threshold during training

### Quantile Loss

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$L_\tau(y, \hat{y}) = \begin{cases}
\tau(y - \hat{y}) & \text{if } y \geq \hat{y} \\
(\tau - 1)(y - \hat{y}) & \text{if } y < \hat{y}
\end{cases}$$

Where $\tau \in (0, 1)$ is the desired quantile.

**Quantile Regression**:
Minimizing quantile loss yields the $\tau$-th conditional quantile:
$$Q_\tau(Y|X) = \inf\{q : P(Y \leq q | X) \geq \tau\}$$

**Special Cases**:
- **$\tau = 0.5$**: Median regression (equivalent to MAE)
- **$\tau = 0.25, 0.75$**: Quartile regression
- **$\tau \to 0$ or $\tau \to 1$**: Extreme quantile estimation

**Applications**:
- **Risk assessment**: Estimate tail risks and extreme values
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Multiple quantiles provide uncertainty intervals
- **Heteroscedastic data**: Different quantiles capture varying uncertainty
- **Financial modeling**: Value-at-Risk and conditional Value-at-Risk

### Log-Cosh Loss

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$L(y, \hat{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(\cosh(\hat{y}_i - y_i))$$

**Properties**:
- **Smooth**: Twice differentiable everywhere
- **MSE-like for small errors**: $\log(\cosh(x)) \approx \frac{x^2}{2}$ for small $x$
- **MAE-like for large errors**: $\log(\cosh(x)) \approx |x| - \log(2)$ for large $x$
- **Bounded gradients**: Prevents exploding gradients

**Gradient Analysis**:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}_i} = \tanh(\hat{y}_i - y_i)$$

**Benefits**:
- **Robust optimization**: Smooth gradients prevent optimization issues
- **Outlier handling**: Less sensitive than MSE but more than MAE
- **GPU-friendly**: Efficient computation on modern hardware

## Classification Loss Functions

### Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

**Mathematical Definition**:
For binary classification with sigmoid output:
$$\text{BCE}(y, p) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} [y_i \log(p_i) + (1-y_i) \log(1-p_i)]$$

Where $p_i = \sigma(f(x_i)) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-f(x_i)}}$.

**Logistic Regression Connection**:
BCE corresponds to negative log-likelihood of Bernoulli distribution:
$$p(y|x) = p^y (1-p)^{1-y}$$

**Properties**:
- **Convex**: In the logit space
- **Proper scoring rule**: Encourages honest probability estimates
- **Unbounded**: Can grow arbitrarily large for confident wrong predictions
- **Asymmetric**: Different penalties for false positives vs false negatives

**Gradient Analysis**:
$$\frac{\partial \text{BCE}}{\partial f(x_i)} = p_i - y_i$$

Clean gradient that's large when predictions are wrong, small when correct.

**Numerical Stability**:
Implementation requires care for numerical stability:
$$\text{BCE} = -y \log(\sigma(x)) - (1-y) \log(1-\sigma(x))$$

Can be computed as:
$$\text{BCE} = \max(x, 0) - xy + \log(1 + e^{-|x|})$$

### Multi-Class Cross-Entropy Loss

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$\text{CE}(y, p) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{C} y_{ij} \log(p_{ij})$$

Where $p_{ij} = \frac{e^{f_j(x_i)}}{\sum_{k=1}^{C} e^{f_k(x_i)}}$ (softmax).

**One-Hot Encoding**:
For one-hot encoded targets: $\mathbf{y}_i = [0, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 0]$
$$\text{CE}(y, p) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(p_{i,c_i})$$

Where $c_i$ is the true class for sample $i$.

**Softmax Properties**:
- **Probability distribution**: $\sum_{j=1}^{C} p_{ij} = 1$, $p_{ij} \geq 0$
- **Differentiable**: Smooth gradients for optimization
- **Winner-take-all**: Largest logit gets highest probability
- **Temperature scaling**: Can adjust prediction confidence

**Gradient Analysis**:
$$\frac{\partial \text{CE}}{\partial f_j(x_i)} = p_{ij} - y_{ij}$$

**Label Smoothing**:
Regularization technique that softens one-hot labels:
$$y'_{ij} = (1 - \alpha) y_{ij} + \frac{\alpha}{C}$$

Benefits:
- **Prevents overconfidence**: Encourages less peaked predictions
- **Better calibration**: Improves probability calibration
- **Regularization**: Acts as implicit regularization

### Sparse Cross-Entropy Loss

**Mathematical Definition**:
When targets are class indices rather than one-hot vectors:
$$\text{SparseCE}(y, p) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(p_{i,y_i})$$

Where $y_i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, C\}$ is the class index.

**Computational Advantages**:
- **Memory efficiency**: No need to store one-hot vectors
- **Computational efficiency**: Only compute loss for true class
- **Large vocabulary**: Essential for tasks with large output vocabularies

### Hinge Loss (SVM Loss)

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$L(y, f(x)) = \max(0, 1 - y \cdot f(x))$$

For multi-class (one-vs-all):
$$L(y, f(x)) = \sum_{j \neq y} \max(0, f_j(x) - f_y(x) + 1)$$

**Properties**:
- **Margin-based**: Focuses on decision boundary margin
- **Sparse**: Zero loss for correctly classified samples beyond margin
- **Convex**: Enables efficient optimization
- **Not probabilistic**: Doesn't output probabilities

**Squared Hinge Loss**:
$$L(y, f(x)) = \max(0, 1 - y \cdot f(x))^2$$

- **Smooth**: Differentiable everywhere
- **Stronger penalties**: Quadratic penalty for misclassifications

### Focal Loss

**Mathematical Definition**:
$$\text{FL}(p, y) = -\alpha (1-p)^\gamma \log(p)$$

Where:
- $p$: Predicted probability for true class
- $\alpha$: Weighting factor for class imbalance
- $\gamma$: Focusing parameter (typically 2)

**Motivation**:
Addresses class imbalance by down-weighting easy examples:
- **Easy examples**: $(1-p)^\gamma \approx 0$ when $p \approx 1$
- **Hard examples**: $(1-p)^\gamma \approx 1$ when $p \approx 0$

**Properties**:
- **Dynamic weighting**: Automatically focuses on hard examples
- **Class imbalance**: Handles imbalanced datasets effectively
- **Hyperparameter sensitive**: Requires tuning of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$

**Applications**:
- **Object detection**: Originally developed for dense object detection
- **Medical diagnosis**: Where rare conditions are critical
- **Natural language**: For tasks with highly imbalanced classes

## Advanced Loss Functions

### Contrastive and Metric Learning Losses

**Contrastive Loss**:
For learning embeddings where similar samples should be close:
$$L = \frac{1}{2N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y d^2 + (1-y) \max(0, m-d)^2]$$

Where:
- $d$: Euclidean distance between embeddings
- $y$: Binary label (1 for similar, 0 for dissimilar)
- $m$: Margin parameter

**Triplet Loss**:
For learning embeddings using triplets (anchor, positive, negative):
$$L = \max(0, d(a, p) - d(a, n) + \alpha)$$

Where:
- $a, p, n$: Anchor, positive, negative embeddings
- $\alpha$: Margin parameter

**Center Loss**:
Encourages features of same class to cluster around class centers:
$$L_{center} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \|x_i - c_{y_i}\|_2^2$$

Where $c_{y_i}$ is the center of class $y_i$.

### Adversarial and GAN Losses

**Binary Adversarial Loss**:
$$L_D = -\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log D(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]$$
$$L_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log D(G(z))]$$

**Wasserstein Loss (WGAN)**:
$$L_D = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[D(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[D(G(z))]$$
$$L_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[D(G(z))]$$

**Least Squares GAN Loss**:
$$L_D = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[(D(x) - 1)^2] + \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[D(G(z))^2]$$
$$L_G = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[(D(G(z)) - 1)^2]$$

### Ranking and Structured Losses

**Listwise Ranking Loss**:
For learning to rank problems:
$$L = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{e^{r_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{r_j}} \log \frac{e^{r_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{r_j}}$$

**Structured Hinge Loss**:
For structured prediction:
$$L(y, \hat{y}) = \max_{y'} [\Delta(y, y') + f(x, y') - f(x, y)]$$

Where $\Delta(y, y')$ is the structured loss between true and predicted structures.

## Loss Function Combinations and Multi-Task Learning

### Weighted Loss Combinations

**Linear Combination**:
$$L_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{T} \lambda_i L_i$$

Where $\lambda_i$ are task-specific weights and $L_i$ are individual task losses.

**Adaptive Weighting**:
$$\lambda_i(t) = \frac{L_i(0)}{L_i(t)} \cdot \lambda_i(0)$$

Automatically balances losses based on their relative magnitudes.

**Uncertainty-Based Weighting**:
$$L_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{T} \frac{1}{2\sigma_i^2} L_i + \log \sigma_i$$

Where $\sigma_i$ represents learned uncertainty for task $i$.

### Curriculum and Progressive Losses

**Curriculum Learning**:
Start with easier examples and gradually increase difficulty:
$$L(t) = \sum_{i} w_i(t) \ell(f(x_i), y_i)$$

Where $w_i(t)$ increases over time for harder examples.

**Self-Paced Learning**:
Let model determine its own curriculum:
$$\min_{w,\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \ell(f(x_i; \theta), y_i) + g(w, \lambda)$$

Where $g(w, \lambda)$ is a regularizer on the sample weights $w$.

### Auxiliary and Regularization Losses

**Auxiliary Tasks**:
Additional supervised tasks to improve main task performance:
$$L = L_{main} + \alpha L_{aux}$$

**Knowledge Distillation**:
$$L = \alpha L_{CE}(y, \sigma(z_s/T)) + \beta L_{KD}(\sigma(z_t/T), \sigma(z_s/T))$$

Where:
- $z_s, z_t$: Student and teacher logits
- $T$: Temperature parameter
