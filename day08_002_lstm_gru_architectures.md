# Day 8.2: LSTM and GRU Architectures - Advanced Recurrent Networks

## Overview
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks represent pivotal innovations in sequence modeling that address the fundamental limitations of vanilla RNNs through sophisticated gating mechanisms. These architectures emerged from the critical need to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data while mitigating the vanishing gradient problem that plagued traditional recurrent networks. The mathematical elegance of LSTM and GRU lies in their ability to selectively remember, forget, and update information through learnable gates, creating a controllable memory system that can maintain relevant information across arbitrary time spans. This comprehensive exploration examines the mathematical foundations, architectural innovations, and practical implications of these gated recurrent architectures that dominated sequence modeling before the transformer revolution.

## LSTM Architecture and Mathematical Framework

### The Memory Cell Concept

**Cell State Evolution**
The fundamental innovation of LSTM is the cell state $C_t$ that flows through time with minimal modifications:
$$C_t = f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t$$

Where:
- $C_t \in \mathbb{R}^H$: Cell state at time $t$
- $f_t \in [0,1]^H$: Forget gate activations
- $i_t \in [0,1]^H$: Input gate activations  
- $\tilde{C}_t \in [-1,1]^H$: Candidate values

**Information Flow Control**
The cell state provides a "highway" for information flow, allowing gradients to propagate through time with minimal degradation when gates are appropriately configured.

### LSTM Gate Mechanisms

**Forget Gate**
Controls what information to discard from cell state:
$$f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$$

**Input Gate and Candidate Values**
Determines what new information to store:
$$i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)$$
$$\tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)$$

**Output Gate**
Controls what parts of cell state to output:
$$o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)$$

**Hidden State Computation**
$$h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(C_t)$$

### Complete LSTM Equations

**Forward Pass**
$$\begin{align}
f_t &= \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \\
i_t &= \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \\
\tilde{C}_t &= \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) \\
C_t &= f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t \\
o_t &= \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \\
h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t)
\end{align}$$

**Matrix Form**
$$\begin{bmatrix} f_t \\ i_t \\ \tilde{C}_t \\ o_t \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma \\ \sigma \\ \tanh \\ \sigma \end{bmatrix} \left(W \begin{bmatrix} h_{t-1} \\ x_t \end{bmatrix} + b\right)$$

Where $W \in \mathbb{R}^{4H \times (H + D)}$ contains all gate weight matrices.

### Gradient Flow Analysis

**Cell State Gradient**
$$\frac{\partial C_t}{\partial C_{t-1}} = f_t$$

**Gradient Accumulation**
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial C_k} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial C_t} \prod_{i=k+1}^{t} f_i + \sum_{j=k+1}^{t} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial C_j} \prod_{i=j+1}^{t} f_i \frac{\partial}{\partial C_k}(i_j \odot \tilde{C}_j)$$

**Gradient Flow Advantages**
- **Unimpeded flow**: When $f_t \approx 1$, gradients flow unchanged
- **Controlled forgetting**: When $f_t \approx 0$, irrelevant information is discarded
- **Selective updating**: Input gate $i_t$ controls what new information affects gradients

## LSTM Variants and Improvements

### Peephole Connections

**Motivation**
Standard LSTM gates only see current input and previous hidden state, not the cell state itself.

**Peephole LSTM Equations**
$$\begin{align}
f_t &= \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + W_{cf} \cdot C_{t-1} + b_f) \\
i_t &= \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + W_{ci} \cdot C_{t-1} + b_i) \\
o_t &= \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + W_{co} \cdot C_t + b_o)
\end{align}$$

Where $W_{cf}, W_{ci}, W_{co}$ are diagonal weight matrices for peephole connections.

### Coupled Input and Forget Gates

**Motivation**
Input and forget gates often exhibit complementary behavior: $i_t \approx 1 - f_t$

**Coupled Gate Equations**
$$f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$$
$$i_t = 1 - f_t$$
$$C_t = f_t \odot C_{t-1} + (1-f_t) \odot \tilde{C}_t$$

**Advantages**
- Reduced parameters
- Enforced conservation of information
- Improved training stability

### LSTM with Recurrent Batch Normalization

**Batch Normalization in Recurrent Networks**
$$\hat{h}_t = \frac{h_t - \mu_t}{\sqrt{\sigma_t^2 + \epsilon}} \gamma + \beta$$

**Separate Normalization for Gates**
$$f_t = \sigma(\text{BN}(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) + b_f)$$

**Population Statistics**
Maintain separate statistics for each time step during training, use population statistics during inference.

### Layer Normalized LSTM

**Layer Normalization Application**
$$f_t = \sigma(\text{LN}(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) + b_f)$$

Where Layer Normalization:
$$\text{LN}(x) = \gamma \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma + \epsilon} + \beta$$

**Advantages over Batch Normalization**
- Independent of batch size
- Consistent across training and inference
- Better suited for sequential processing

## GRU Architecture

### Simplified Gating Mechanism

**Reset Gate**
Controls how much past information to forget:
$$r_t = \sigma(W_r \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_r)$$

**Update Gate**
Controls how much of the hidden state to update:
$$z_t = \sigma(W_z \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_z)$$

**Candidate Hidden State**
$$\tilde{h}_t = \tanh(W_h \cdot [r_t \odot h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_h)$$

**Final Hidden State**
$$h_t = (1-z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t$$

### Complete GRU Equations

**Matrix Form**
$$\begin{bmatrix} r_t \\ z_t \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma \\ \sigma \end{bmatrix} \left(W_{rz} \begin{bmatrix} h_{t-1} \\ x_t \end{bmatrix} + b_{rz}\right)$$

$$\tilde{h}_t = \tanh\left(W_h \begin{bmatrix} r_t \odot h_{t-1} \\ x_t \end{bmatrix} + b_h\right)$$

$$h_t = (1-z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t$$

### GRU vs LSTM Comparison

**Architectural Differences**
- **Gates**: GRU has 2 gates, LSTM has 3
- **State**: GRU has single hidden state, LSTM has cell state + hidden state
- **Parameters**: GRU has ~25% fewer parameters than LSTM

**Mathematical Relationship**
GRU can be viewed as LSTM variant where:
- Forget and input gates are coupled: $i_t = 1 - f_t$
- Output gate is always 1: $o_t = 1$
- Cell state equals hidden state: $C_t = h_t$

**Performance Characteristics**
- **Training speed**: GRU typically faster due to fewer parameters
- **Memory usage**: GRU uses less memory
- **Expressiveness**: LSTM potentially more expressive due to separate cell state

## Advanced Gated Architectures

### Minimal Gated Unit (MGU)

**Further Simplification**
Single gate controlling both forget and input:
$$f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$$
$$\tilde{h}_t = \tanh(W_h \cdot [f_t \odot h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_h)$$
$$h_t = (1-f_t) \odot h_{t-1} + f_t \odot \tilde{h}_t$$

### Simple Recurrent Unit (SRU)

**Highway Network Inspiration**
$$\tilde{h}_t = W x_t$$
$$f_t = \sigma(W_f x_t + b_f)$$
$$r_t = \sigma(W_r x_t + b_r)$$
$$c_t = f_t \odot c_{t-1} + (1-f_t) \odot \tilde{h}_t$$
$$h_t = r_t \odot \tanh(c_t) + (1-r_t) \odot x_t$$

**Parallelization Advantage**
Gates depend only on current input, enabling parallelization across time steps.

### Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs)

**Convolutional Gates**
$$Z_t = \tanh(W_z * X)$$
$$F_t = \sigma(W_f * X)$$
$$O_t = \sigma(W_o * X)$$

Where $*$ denotes time-wise convolution.

**Recurrent Pooling**
$$c_t = f_t \odot c_{t-1} + (1-f_t) \odot z_t$$
$$h_t = o_t \odot c_t$$

**Advantages**
- Parallel computation of gates
- Reduced sequential dependencies
- Faster training than traditional RNNs

## Training Dynamics and Optimization

### Initialization Strategies for Gated Networks

**Gate Initialization**
**Forget Gate Bias**: Initialize to positive values (typically 1.0):
$$b_f = \mathbf{1}$$

This encourages remembering initially, allowing gradients to flow.

**Other Gates**: Initialize biases to zero:
$$b_i = b_o = \mathbf{0}$$

**Weight Initialization**
**Xavier/Glorot for Gates**:
$$W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in} + n_{out}}\right)$$

**Orthogonal for Recurrent Weights**:
$$W_h \sim \text{Orthogonal}(H, H)$$

### Gradient Clipping in Gated Networks

**Necessity**
Even with gating, exploding gradients can occur when:
- Gates are saturated (near 0 or 1)
- Input magnitudes are large
- Deep networks are used

**Adaptive Clipping**
$$\text{clip\_value}_t = \alpha \cdot \text{clip\_value}_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \cdot \|g_t\|$$

### Learning Rate Schedules

**Warmup for Gated Networks**
$$\eta_t = \begin{cases}
\eta_{max} \frac{t}{T_{warmup}} & t \leq T_{warmup} \\
\eta_{max} \sqrt{\frac{T_{warmup}}{t}} & t > T_{warmup}
\end{cases}$$

**Cosine Annealing with Restarts**
$$\eta_t = \eta_{min} + \frac{1}{2}(\eta_{max} - \eta_{min})(1 + \cos(\frac{T_{cur}}{T_i}\pi))$$

## Bidirectional and Deep Architectures

**Dropout Between Layers**
$$h_t^{(l)} = \text{LSTM}(h_{t-1}^{(l)}, \text{dropout}(h_t^{(l-1)}); \theta^{(l)})$$

## Attention-Augmented Gated Networks

$$e_{t,i} = \text{MLP}([h_t; h_i])$$
$$c_t = \sum_{i=1}^{T} \alpha_{t,i} h_i$$

**Attention-Augmented Output**
$$y_t = W_y[h_t; c_t] + b_y$$

### Hierarchical Attention Networks

$$u_{it} = \tanh(W_w h_{it} + b_w)$$
$$\alpha_{it} = \frac{\exp(u_{it}^T u_w)}{\sum_t \exp(u_{it}^T u_w)}$$
$$s_i = \sum_t \alpha_{it} h_{it}$$

**Sentence-Level Attention**
$$u_i = \tanh(W_s s_i + b_s)$$
$$\alpha_i = \frac{\exp(u_i^T u_s)}{\sum_i \exp(u_i^T u_s)}$$
$$v = \sum_i \alpha_i s_i$$

## Regularization and Generalization

### Dropout Strategies for LSTM/GRU

**Variational Dropout**
Use same dropout mask across time steps:
$$m_x, m_h, m_o \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$$
$$h_t = \text{LSTM}(m_h \odot h_{t-1}, m_x \odot x_t)$$
$$y_t = m_o \odot W h_t$$

**Recurrent Dropout**
$$h_t = \text{LSTM}(D_h(h_{t-1}), x_t)$$

Where $D_h$ applies dropout only to recurrent connections.

**Zoneout**
Randomly maintain previous hidden/cell states:
$$h_t = d_h \odot h_{t-1} + (1-d_h) \odot h_t^{new}$$
$$C_t = d_c \odot C_{t-1} + (1-d_c) \odot C_t^{new}$$

## Theoretical Analysis

### Expressiveness and Universal Approximation

**LSTM Universal Approximation**
LSTMs with sufficient hidden units can approximate any measurable sequence-to-sequence function to arbitrary accuracy.

**Formal Theorem**:
For any $\epsilon > 0$ and continuous function $f: \mathcal{X}^T \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}^S$, there exists an LSTM such that:
$$\sup_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{K}} \|f(\mathbf{x}) - \text{LSTM}(\mathbf{x})\| < \epsilon$$

for any compact set $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathcal{X}^T$.

### Memory Capacity Analysis

**Effective Memory Span**
The effective memory span of LSTM is approximately:
$$T_{eff} \approx \frac{1}{-\log(\mathbb{E}[f_t])}$$

**Information Storage**
LSTM cell state can theoretically store:
$$I_{max} = H \log_2(2^B)$$

bits of information, where $B$ is the precision of cell state values.

### Gradient Flow Properties

**Gradient Variance**
$$\text{Var}\left[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_1}\right] \approx \text{Var}\left[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_T}\right]$$

This property, unique to gated architectures, enables stable training on long sequences.

**Critical Point Analysis**
LSTM loss landscapes typically have:
- Fewer bad local minima than vanilla RNNs
- More saddle points than minima
- Smoother optimization paths

## Hardware Optimization and Implementation

### GPU-Optimized Implementations

**Batched Matrix Operations**
Combine all gate computations:
$$\begin{bmatrix} F \\ I \\ G \\ O \end{bmatrix} = \sigma \begin{bmatrix} W_f \\ W_i \\ W_g \\ W_o \end{bmatrix} [H_{prev}; X]$$

**Memory Layout Optimization**
- **Contiguous memory**: Store related tensors contiguously
- **Coalesced access**: Ensure GPU memory access patterns are coalesced
- **Shared memory**: Utilize GPU shared memory for frequently accessed data

### Quantization and Compression

**8-bit Quantization**
$$W_{int8} = \text{Round}\left(\frac{W_{fp32}}{\text{scale}}\right)$$

**Pruning Strategies**
- **Magnitude-based pruning**: Remove smallest weights
- **Structured pruning**: Remove entire neurons/channels
- **Gradual pruning**: Slowly increase sparsity during training

### Mobile and Edge Deployment
