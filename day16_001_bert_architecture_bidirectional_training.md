# Day 16.1: BERT Architecture and Bidirectional Training - Revolutionary Language Understanding

## Overview

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) represents a paradigm-shifting breakthrough in natural language understanding that fundamentally changed the landscape of NLP by introducing truly bidirectional contextualized representations through innovative masked language modeling and next sentence prediction objectives. Unlike traditional left-to-right or shallow bidirectional models, BERT leverages the full power of bidirectional context by simultaneously conditioning on both left and right context in all layers, enabling deep bidirectional representations that capture richer linguistic understanding than previously possible. This architectural innovation, combined with the transformer encoder backbone, creates a powerful foundation model that can be fine-tuned for a wide variety of downstream tasks, establishing the transfer learning paradigm that dominates modern NLP. The mathematical foundations of BERT's bidirectional training, the architectural design choices that enable effective pretraining and transfer, and the theoretical principles underlying masked language modeling provide crucial insights into why BERT achieved such remarkable success across diverse language understanding tasks.

## Historical Context and Motivation

### Limitations of Directional Models

**Unidirectional Language Models**
Traditional language models process sequences in one direction:
$$P(\mathbf{x}) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | x_1, x_2, ..., x_{i-1})$$

**ELMo's Shallow Bidirectionality**
ELMo concatenates forward and backward representations:
$$\mathbf{h}_i^{\text{ELMo}} = [\overleftarrow{\mathbf{h}}_i; \overrightarrow{\mathbf{h}}_i]$$

**Limitations**:
- **Independent processing**: Forward and backward models trained separately
- **Shallow fusion**: Concatenation doesn't enable deep interaction
- **Limited context integration**: Each direction sees only half the context during training

**GPT's Left-to-Right Constraint**
GPT uses causal masking to maintain autoregressive property:
$$\text{Attention}(i, j) = \begin{cases}
\text{computed} & \text{if } j \leq i \\
-\infty & \text{if } j > i
\end{cases}$$

**Problem**: Cannot access future context for understanding tasks.

### The Bidirectionality Challenge

**Fundamental Problem**
How can we train a model to use full bidirectional context without "seeing the answer" in language modeling?

**Traditional Solutions**:
1. **Separate models**: Train forward and backward models independently
2. **Feature-based**: Extract features from pretrained models
3. **Task-specific**: Design architectures for specific tasks

**BERT's Innovation**
Use masking to hide target words, enabling bidirectional training:
- **Masked Language Model (MLM)**: Predict masked words using full context
- **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**: Learn sentence relationships
- **Deep bidirectional representations**: All layers see full context

## BERT Architecture Deep Dive

### Encoder-Only Transformer

**Architecture Choice**
BERT uses only the encoder part of the Transformer:
- **No decoder**: Focuses on representation learning, not generation
- **Bidirectional attention**: All positions can attend to all positions
- **Deep context**: Multiple layers of bidirectional processing

**Mathematical Framework**
For input sequence $\mathbf{X} = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$:

**Layer 0 (Input)**:
$$\mathbf{H}^{(0)} = \text{TokenEmbedding}(\mathbf{X}) + \text{PositionEmbedding} + \text{SegmentEmbedding}$$

**Layer $\ell$ ($\ell = 1, ..., L$)**:
$$\mathbf{A}^{(\ell)} = \text{MultiHeadAttention}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)}, \mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)}, \mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)})$$
$$\mathbf{H}^{(\ell)} = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)} + \text{FFN}(\text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)} + \mathbf{A}^{(\ell)})))$$

**Final Representations**:
$$\text{BERT}(\mathbf{X}) = \mathbf{H}^{(L)}$$

### Model Configurations

**BERT-Base**
- **Layers (L)**: 12
- **Hidden size (H)**: 768
- **Attention heads (A)**: 12
- **Feed-forward size**: 3072
- **Total parameters**: 110M

**BERT-Large**
- **Layers (L)**: 24
- **Hidden size (H)**: 1024
- **Attention heads (A)**: 16
- **Feed-forward size**: 4096
- **Total parameters**: 340M

**Architectural Decisions**
- **Head dimension**: $d_k = H/A = 64$ (consistent across sizes)
- **FFN expansion**: $d_{ff} = 4H$ (standard transformer ratio)
- **Vocabulary**: 30,522 WordPiece tokens
- **Max sequence length**: 512 tokens

### Input Representation

**Three Embedding Components**

**1. Token Embeddings**
WordPiece tokenization with learnable embeddings:
$$\mathbf{E}_{\text{token}}(x_i) \in \mathbb{R}^{H}$$

**Special tokens**:
- `[CLS]`: Classification token (sequence start)
- `[SEP]`: Separator token (between sentences)
- `[MASK]`: Masked token for MLM
- `[PAD]`: Padding token
- `[UNK]`: Unknown token

**2. Position Embeddings**
Learned absolute position embeddings:
$$\mathbf{E}_{\text{pos}}(i) \in \mathbb{R}^{H}, \quad i = 0, 1, ..., 511$$

**Difference from Transformers**: Learned instead of sinusoidal encodings.

**3. Segment Embeddings**
Distinguish between different sentences:
$$\mathbf{E}_{\text{seg}}(s) = \begin{cases}
\mathbf{E}_A & \text{if token belongs to sentence A} \\
\mathbf{E}_B & \text{if token belongs to sentence B}
\end{cases}$$

**Combined Input**:
$$\mathbf{h}_i^{(0)} = \mathbf{E}_{\text{token}}(x_i) + \mathbf{E}_{\text{pos}}(i) + \mathbf{E}_{\text{seg}}(s_i)$$

### Bidirectional Self-Attention

**Attention Computation**
Unlike GPT, BERT allows all positions to attend to all positions:
$$\mathbf{A}_{i,j} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}_i \mathbf{K}_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)$$

**No masking constraint**: All attention weights $\mathbf{A}_{i,j}$ are computed.

**Information Flow**
Each position receives information from entire sequence:
$$\mathbf{h}_i^{(\ell)} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \mathbf{A}_{i,j}^{(\ell)} \mathbf{V}_j^{(\ell-1)}$$

**Deep Bidirectional Context**
At layer $\ell$, position $i$ has access to:
- **Direct context**: All positions at layer $\ell-1$
- **Indirect context**: All positions through $\ell$ layers of processing

**Mathematical Analysis**
The effective receptive field grows exponentially with depth:
$$\text{ReceptiveField}^{(\ell)} = \text{SequenceLength}$$

Every position can influence every other position through $\ell$ steps of attention.

## Masked Language Modeling (MLM)

### Core MLM Objective

**Masking Strategy**
Randomly mask 15% of input tokens:
- **80%**: Replace with `[MASK]` token
- **10%**: Replace with random token
- **10%**: Keep original token

**Mathematical Formulation**
For input sequence $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, ..., x_n]$, create masked version $\mathbf{x}^{\text{mask}}$:
$$x_i^{\text{mask}} = \begin{cases}
\text{[MASK]} & \text{with probability } 0.15 \times 0.8 = 0.12 \\
\text{random token} & \text{with probability } 0.15 \times 0.1 = 0.015 \\
x_i & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**MLM Loss**
Predict only masked tokens:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{MLM}} = -\sum_{i \in \mathcal{M}} \log P(x_i | \mathbf{x}^{\text{mask}})$$

where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of masked positions.

**Prediction Computation**
$$P(x_i | \mathbf{x}^{\text{mask}}) = \text{softmax}(W_{\text{vocab}} \mathbf{h}_i^{(L)} + \mathbf{b})$$

where $W_{\text{vocab}} \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times H}$ is the output vocabulary projection.

### Theoretical Justification for MLM

**Why Not Standard Language Modeling?**
Standard LM objective with bidirectional context:
$$P(x_i | x_1, ..., x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, ..., x_n)$$

**Problem**: Model could trivially predict $x_i$ by "looking at itself."

**MLM Solution**
Hide the target token, forcing model to use context:
$$P(x_i | x_1, ..., x_{i-1}, \text{[MASK]}, x_{i+1}, ..., x_n)$$

**Denoising Autoencoder Perspective**
MLM can be viewed as denoising:
- **Original**: $\mathbf{x}$
- **Corrupted**: $\mathbf{x}^{\text{mask}}$ (noise added by masking)
- **Reconstruct**: $\hat{\mathbf{x}} = \text{BERT}(\mathbf{x}^{\text{mask}})$

**Objective**: $\min \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}, \hat{\mathbf{x}})]$

### MLM Training Dynamics

**Masking Randomness**
Different masking patterns create diverse training examples:
- **Same sentence, different masks**: Multiple training signals
- **Context diversity**: Different contexts for same target words
- **Robustness**: Model learns to handle various missing information patterns

**10% Random Token Strategy**
**Purpose**: Prevent model from relying on `[MASK]` token presence
**Effect**: Model must predict based on context, not just mask detection

**10% Original Token Strategy**
**Purpose**: Provide supervision signal for unmasked tokens
**Effect**: Model learns to verify correct tokens in context

**Convergence Properties**
MLM training exhibits:
- **Slower convergence**: Compared to standard LM (only 15% tokens predicted)
- **Richer representations**: Bidirectional context creates better embeddings
- **Task transfer**: Representations transfer well to downstream tasks

### Information-Theoretic Analysis

**Mutual Information in MLM**
The MLM objective maximizes mutual information between masked tokens and context:
$$I(X_{\mathcal{M}}; X_{\mathcal{M}^c}) = H(X_{\mathcal{M}}) - H(X_{\mathcal{M}} | X_{\mathcal{M}^c})$$

**Conditional Entropy Minimization**
$$H(X_{\mathcal{M}} | X_{\mathcal{M}^c}) = -\sum_{i \in \mathcal{M}} \sum_{x_i} P(x_i | \mathbf{x}_{\mathcal{M}^c}) \log P(x_i | \mathbf{x}_{\mathcal{M}^c})$$

**Bidirectional Information**
Unlike unidirectional models, BERT maximizes:
$$I(X_i; X_1, ..., X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, ..., X_n)$$

## Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)

### NSP Objective Design

**Sentence Pair Classification**
Given two sentences A and B, predict if B follows A:
$$P(\text{IsNext} | A, B) = \text{sigmoid}(W_{\text{NSP}} \mathbf{h}_{\text{[CLS]}}^{(L)})$$

**Training Data Construction**
- **50% Positive**: B actually follows A in corpus
- **50% Negative**: B is random sentence from corpus

**Input Format**:
```
[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]
```

**Loss Function**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{NSP}} = -\log P(\text{label} | A, B)$$

where label $\in \{\text{IsNext}, \text{NotNext}\}$.

### Theoretical Motivation for NSP

**Discourse Understanding**
NSP encourages learning of:
- **Coherence**: Logical flow between sentences
- **Topical consistency**: Maintaining topic across sentences
- **Discourse markers**: Linguistic cues for sentence relationships

**Representation Learning**
The `[CLS]` token aggregates sentence-level information:
$$\mathbf{h}_{\text{[CLS]}}^{(L)} = f(\text{SentenceA}, \text{SentenceB})$$

**Cross-Sentence Attention**
NSP training enables attention across sentence boundaries:
$$\mathbf{A}_{i \in A, j \in B} = \text{attention between sentences A and B}$$

### Combined Training Objective

**Joint Loss Function**
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{BERT}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{MLM}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{NSP}}$$

**Multi-Task Learning Benefits**:
1. **Complementary signals**: MLM for token-level, NSP for sentence-level
2. **Regularization**: Multiple objectives prevent overfitting
3. **Rich representations**: Model learns multiple aspects of language

**Training Procedure**
```
1. Sample sentence pair (A, B)
2. Create NSP label (50% positive, 50% negative)
3. Concatenate: [CLS] A [SEP] B [SEP]
4. Apply MLM masking (15% of tokens)
5. Forward pass through BERT
6. Compute MLM loss on masked tokens
7. Compute NSP loss on [CLS] representation
8. Backpropagate combined loss
```

## Bidirectional Context Analysis

### Attention Pattern Analysis

**Bidirectional Information Flow**
In BERT, each token attends to entire sequence:
$$\text{Context}(i) = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, ..., x_n\}$$

**Attention Entropy**
Bidirectional models typically have higher attention entropy:
$$H(\text{Attention}_i) = -\sum_j \alpha_{ij} \log \alpha_{ij}$$

**Empirical Observations**:
- **Higher entropy**: More distributed attention patterns
- **Long-range dependencies**: Better capture of distant relationships
- **Syntactic patterns**: Attention aligns with syntactic dependencies

### Representation Quality Analysis

**Contextual Sensitivity**
BERT representations change based on context:
$$\text{sim}(\text{BERT}(\text{word in context}_1), \text{BERT}(\text{word in context}_2)) \neq 1$$

**Polysemy Resolution**
Different senses of same word get different representations:
- **"bank"** (financial): Different vector than **"bank"** (river)
- **Context-dependent**: Representation adapts to surrounding words

**Linear Probing Analysis**
BERT representations encode multiple linguistic properties:
- **Syntax**: Part-of-speech, syntactic dependencies
- **Semantics**: Word sense, semantic roles
- **Discourse**: Coreference, discourse relations

### Comparison with Unidirectional Models

**Representation Comparison**
| Aspect | BERT (Bidirectional) | GPT (Unidirectional) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Context | Full sequence | Left context only |
| Training | MLM + NSP | Next token prediction |
| Attention | Unrestricted | Causal masking |
| Use case | Understanding tasks | Generation tasks |

**Mathematical Difference**
**BERT attention**:
$$\mathbf{A}_{i,j} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{q}_i^T \mathbf{k}_j}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) \quad \forall i,j$$

**GPT attention**:
$$\mathbf{A}_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
\text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{q}_i^T \mathbf{k}_j}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) & \text{if } j \leq i \\
0 & \text{if } j > i
\end{cases}$$

## Architectural Innovations

### Pre-normalization vs Post-normalization

**BERT's Layer Normalization**
BERT uses post-normalization (original Transformer design):
$$\mathbf{H}^{(\ell)} = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)} + \text{MultiHeadAttention}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)}))$$

**Alternative: Pre-normalization**
$$\mathbf{H}^{(\ell)} = \mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)} + \text{MultiHeadAttention}(\text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)}))$$

**Trade-offs**:
- **Post-norm**: Better final performance, harder to train
- **Pre-norm**: Easier training, potentially lower performance

### Activation Functions

**GELU Activation**
BERT uses GELU instead of ReLU:
$$\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]$$

**Properties**:
- **Smooth**: Differentiable everywhere
- **Probabilistic**: Weighted identity function
- **Better gradients**: Reduced dead neuron problem

**Approximation**:
$$\text{GELU}(x) \approx 0.5x\left(1 + \tanh\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\left(x + 0.044715x^3\right)\right)\right)$$

### WordPiece Tokenization

**Subword Algorithm**
WordPiece uses iterative merging:
1. Start with character vocabulary
2. Merge most frequent adjacent pairs
3. Continue until target vocabulary size

**Likelihood-based Merging**
Choose merge that maximizes training data likelihood:
$$\text{score}(x, y) = \frac{\text{count}(xy)}{\text{count}(x) \times \text{count}(y)}$$

**Benefits for BERT**:
- **OOV handling**: Rare words decomposed into subwords
- **Morphology**: Captures morphological relationships
- **Vocabulary efficiency**: Fixed vocabulary handles unlimited words

## Training Infrastructure

### Computational Requirements

**Memory Analysis**
BERT-Base training memory requirements:
- **Model parameters**: 110M × 4 bytes = 440MB
- **Optimizer states**: Adam requires 2× parameters = 880MB
- **Gradients**: Same as parameters = 440MB
- **Activations**: Depends on batch size and sequence length

**Attention Memory**
For batch size $B$, sequence length $L$, heads $H$:
$$\text{Memory}_{\text{attention}} = B \times H \times L^2 \times 4 \text{ bytes}$$

**Example**: $B=32$, $L=512$, $H=12$: ~400MB just for attention matrices.

### Distributed Training Strategy

**Data Parallelism**
BERT training typically uses data parallelism:
- **Multiple GPUs**: Each processes different batch subset
- **Gradient synchronization**: All-reduce gradients across GPUs
- **Parameter updates**: Synchronized across all devices

**Gradient Accumulation**
For large effective batch sizes:
```python
effective_batch_size = batch_size × gradient_accumulation_steps × num_gpus
```

**Mixed Precision Training**
Using FP16 for memory efficiency:
- **Memory reduction**: ~50% for activations and gradients
- **Speed improvement**: 1.5-2x speedup on modern GPUs
- **Numerical stability**: Loss scaling prevents underflow
