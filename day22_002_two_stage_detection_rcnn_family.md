# Day 22.2: Two-Stage Detection Models - R-CNN Family Deep Dive

## Overview

Two-stage object detection models represent a sophisticated approach to computer vision that separates the complex task of object detection into two distinct and manageable phases: region proposal generation followed by classification and bounding box refinement, enabling more accurate localization and classification through dedicated optimization of each component while providing a principled framework for handling the inherent challenges of object detection across diverse scales, aspect ratios, and visual contexts. Understanding the R-CNN family of detectors, from the original R-CNN through Fast R-CNN to Faster R-CNN and beyond, reveals the evolution of deep learning-based object detection and the architectural innovations that have shaped modern computer vision systems. This comprehensive exploration examines the mathematical foundations of two-stage detection, the architectural components that enable effective region proposal and classification, the training strategies that optimize both stages jointly or separately, and the theoretical analysis that explains why two-stage approaches achieve superior accuracy compared to single-stage methods, while also addressing the computational trade-offs and practical considerations that influence their deployment in real-world applications.

## Two-Stage Detection Paradigm

### Conceptual Framework and Motivation

**Divide and Conquer Strategy**:
Two-stage detection decomposes object detection into two specialized subproblems:
1. **Where**: Generate candidate object locations (region proposals)
2. **What**: Classify objects and refine bounding boxes

This separation allows each stage to be optimized independently and enables the use of specialized architectures for each task.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
Given an input image $I$, two-stage detection computes:
$$\text{Stage 1}: \mathcal{P} = \{(b_i, s_i)\}_{i=1}^{N} = \text{RPN}(I)$$
$$\text{Stage 2}: \mathcal{D} = \{(b_j', c_j, s_j')\}_{j=1}^{M} = \text{Head}(\text{Features}(I), \mathcal{P})$$

where $\mathcal{P}$ are region proposals and $\mathcal{D}$ are final detections.

**Advantages of Two-Stage Approach**:
- **Higher Precision**: Two-stage refinement improves localization accuracy
- **Better Recall**: Systematic region proposal generation reduces missed detections
- **Specialized Optimization**: Each stage can be optimized for its specific task
- **Interpretability**: Clear separation of proposal generation and classification

**Computational Trade-offs**:
- **Accuracy vs Speed**: Higher accuracy at the cost of increased inference time
- **Memory Requirements**: Need to store and process intermediate proposals
- **Training Complexity**: Multi-stage training procedures

### Historical Context and Evolution

**Traditional Object Detection Challenges**:
Before deep learning, object detection relied on:
- **Sliding Window**: Exhaustive search across positions and scales
- **Hand-crafted Features**: HOG, SIFT, etc. for object representation
- **Separate Classifiers**: SVM or other classifiers trained independently

**Deep Learning Motivation**:
The success of CNNs on ImageNet classification motivated researchers to leverage these powerful feature extractors for object detection, leading to the R-CNN family of approaches.

## R-CNN: Regions with CNN Features (2014)

### Architecture and Methodology

**Overall Pipeline**:
The original R-CNN approach consists of three main components:
1. **Region Proposal**: Generate ~2000 category-independent region proposals
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract CNN features for each proposal
3. **Classification**: Train class-specific SVMs and bounding box regressors

**Mathematical Framework**:

**Step 1 - Region Proposals**:
Using Selective Search to generate proposals:
$$\mathcal{R} = \{r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_N\} = \text{SelectiveSearch}(I)$$

where each proposal $r_i$ is a bounding box $(x, y, w, h)$.

**Step 2 - Feature Extraction**:
For each proposal, extract CNN features:
$$\mathbf{f}_i = \text{CNN}(\text{warp}(I, r_i))$$

where $\text{warp}(I, r_i)$ extracts and resizes the proposal region to fixed size (227×227).

**Step 3 - Classification**:
Train binary SVM classifiers for each class $c$:
$$\text{score}_c(r_i) = \mathbf{w}_c^T \mathbf{f}_i + b_c$$

**Step 4 - Bounding Box Regression**:
Learn transformation from proposal to ground truth:
$$\hat{G}_x = P_w d_x(P) + P_x$$
$$\hat{G}_y = P_h d_y(P) + P_y$$
$$\hat{G}_w = P_w \exp(d_w(P))$$
$$\hat{G}_h = P_h \exp(d_h(P))$$

where $(P_x, P_y, P_w, P_h)$ are proposal coordinates and $(d_x, d_y, d_w, d_h)$ are learned transformations.

### CNN Architecture and Pre-training

**AlexNet Backbone**:
R-CNN originally used AlexNet as the CNN backbone:
- **Pre-training**: CNN pre-trained on ImageNet classification
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapted for object detection with different number of classes
- **Feature Dimension**: 4096-dimensional fc7 features

**Fine-tuning Strategy**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{finetune}} = -\sum_{i} \sum_{c} y_{i,c} \log p_{i,c}$$

where positive examples have IoU ≥ 0.5 with ground truth, and negatives have IoU < 0.5.

**Domain Adaptation**:
The CNN learns to adapt from natural image classification to object detection:
- **Distribution Shift**: From centered objects to arbitrary crops
- **Scale Variation**: From single scale to multi-scale objects
- **Background Modeling**: Learning to distinguish objects from background

### Training Procedure

**Multi-Stage Training**:
R-CNN training involves multiple stages:

**Stage 1 - CNN Fine-tuning**:
Fine-tune CNN on detection data:
$$\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}}(\text{CNN}_{\theta}(\text{warp}(I, r_i)), y_i)$$

**Stage 2 - SVM Training**:
Train binary SVMs using CNN features as input:
$$\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{w}\|^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^N \xi_i$$

subject to:
$$y_i(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{f}_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i$$

**Stage 3 - Bounding Box Regression**:
Train linear regression for each class:
$$\min_{\mathbf{W}} \sum_{i=1}^N \|\mathbf{t}^*_i - \mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{f}_i\|^2$$

where $\mathbf{t}^*_i$ are ground truth transformation targets.

**Hard Negative Mining**:
To handle class imbalance, R-CNN uses hard negative mining:
1. Train initial SVM on random negatives
2. Apply SVM to all negative windows
3. Add hard negatives (highest scoring false positives) to training set
4. Retrain SVM
5. Repeat until convergence

### Performance Analysis

**Computational Complexity**:
- **Proposal Generation**: $O(N)$ where $N \approx 2000$
- **CNN Forward Pass**: $O(N \times \text{CNN cost})$ 
- **Classification**: $O(N \times d \times C)$ where $d=4096$, $C$ is number of classes
- **Total**: Dominated by $N$ CNN forward passes

**Memory Requirements**:
- **CNN Features**: $N \times 4096 \times 4$ bytes ≈ 32 MB for single image
- **Proposals**: $N \times 4 \times 4$ bytes ≈ 32 KB for single image
- **SVM Models**: $C \times 4096 \times 4$ bytes per class

**Accuracy Analysis**:
R-CNN achieved significant improvements over previous methods:
- **PASCAL VOC 2007**: 58.5% mAP (vs 35.1% for previous best)
- **PASCAL VOC 2012**: 53.7% mAP
- **ILSVRC 2013**: 31.4% mAP

### Limitations and Challenges

**Computational Inefficiency**:
- **Redundant Computation**: Each proposal requires separate CNN forward pass
- **Storage Requirements**: Need to store features for all proposals
- **Training Complexity**: Multi-stage training procedure

**Fixed Pipeline Components**:
- **Region Proposals**: Selective Search not learned end-to-end
- **Multiple Components**: CNN, SVM, and regressor trained separately
- **Feature Sharing**: No feature sharing between proposal generation and classification

## Fast R-CNN (2015)

### Architectural Innovations

**Unified Architecture**:
Fast R-CNN addresses R-CNN's inefficiencies by:
- **Single CNN Forward Pass**: Process entire image once
- **RoI Pooling**: Extract fixed-size features from variable-size proposals
- **Multi-task Learning**: Joint training of classifier and regressor

**Mathematical Framework**:

**Single-Stage Feature Extraction**:
$$\mathbf{F} = \text{CNN}(I)$$

where $\mathbf{F} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times D}$ is the feature map for the entire image.

**RoI Pooling Operation**:
For each proposal $r_i = (x, y, w, h)$:
$$\mathbf{f}_i = \text{RoIPool}(\mathbf{F}, r_i)$$

where RoI pooling produces fixed-size features regardless of input proposal size.

**Multi-task Output**:
The network produces two outputs for each RoI:
- **Classification scores**: $\mathbf{p}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{C+1}$ (including background)
- **Bounding box regression**: $\mathbf{t}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{4C}$ (class-specific)

### RoI Pooling: Mathematical Analysis

**Problem Formulation**:
Given a feature map $\mathbf{F}$ of size $H \times W \times D$ and a proposal $(x, y, w, h)$, produce a fixed-size output of $H_{out} \times W_{out} \times D$.

**Quantization and Pooling**:
1. **Coordinate Mapping**: Map proposal coordinates to feature map coordinates
   $$x' = \lfloor x / \text{stride} \rfloor, \quad y' = \lfloor y / \text{stride} \rfloor$$
   $$w' = \lceil w / \text{stride} \rceil, \quad h' = \lceil h / \text{stride} \rceil$$

2. **Grid Division**: Divide the mapped region into $H_{out} \times W_{out}$ sub-windows
   $$\text{sub-window}_{i,j} = \left[\left\lfloor i \frac{h'}{H_{out}} \right\rfloor, \left\lceil (i+1) \frac{h'}{H_{out}} \right\rceil\right) \times \left[\left\lfloor j \frac{w'}{W_{out}} \right\rfloor, \left\lceil (j+1) \frac{w'}{W_{out}} \right\rceil\right)$$

3. **Max Pooling**: Apply max pooling within each sub-window
   $$\text{output}_{i,j,c} = \max_{(m,n) \in \text{sub-window}_{i,j}} \mathbf{F}_{x'+m, y'+n, c}$$

**Quantization Effects**:
RoI pooling introduces quantization errors due to:
- **Coordinate Rounding**: Loss of spatial precision
- **Grid Discretization**: Misalignment between proposals and pooling grid

These errors accumulate and can impact localization accuracy.

### Multi-task Learning Framework

**Joint Loss Function**:
Fast R-CNN optimizes a multi-task loss:
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{bbox}}$$

**Classification Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}} = -\log p_u$$

where $u$ is the true class label and $p_u$ is the predicted probability.

**Bounding Box Regression Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{bbox}} = \sum_{i \in \{x,y,w,h\}} \text{smooth}_{L_1}(t_i^u - v_i)$$

where $\text{smooth}_{L_1}$ is the smooth L1 loss:
$$\text{smooth}_{L_1}(x) = \begin{cases}
0.5x^2 & \text{if } |x| < 1 \\
|x| - 0.5 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Loss Balancing**:
The hyperparameter $\lambda$ balances classification and localization:
- **$\lambda = 1$**: Equal weighting (typical choice)
- **Adaptive $\lambda$**: Some implementations use validation-based tuning

### Training Strategy

**Mini-batch Sampling**:
Fast R-CNN uses hierarchical sampling:
1. **Sample Images**: Select $N$ images per mini-batch (typically $N=2$)
2. **Sample RoIs**: Select $R/N$ RoIs per image (typically $R=128$)
3. **Class Balance**: 25% positive RoIs (IoU ≥ 0.5), 75% background (IoU < 0.5)

**Multi-scale Training**:
To handle scale variation:
- **Image Pyramid**: Randomly sample images at different scales
- **Scale Jittering**: Random scale within range [480, 800] pixels

**Hard RoI Sampling**:
Focus training on challenging examples:
$$\text{Hard RoIs} = \{r_i : 0.1 \leq \text{IoU}(r_i, \text{GT}) < 0.5\}$$

### Backward Pass and Gradient Flow

**Gradient Flow Through RoI Pooling**:
The gradient of RoI pooling with respect to input feature:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{F}_{x,y,c}} = \sum_{r} \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \text{output}_{r,i,j,c}} \cdot \mathbb{I}[\arg\max_{(m,n)} \mathbf{F}_{m,n,c} = (x,y)]$$

where the sum is over RoIs $r$ and output positions $(i,j)$.

**End-to-End Training**:
Fast R-CNN enables end-to-end training of the entire detection pipeline except region proposal generation:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \text{outputs}} \frac{\partial \text{outputs}}{\partial \text{features}} \frac{\partial \text{features}}{\partial \theta}$$

### Performance Improvements

**Speed Improvements**:
- **Training**: 9× faster than R-CNN
- **Inference**: 213× faster than R-CNN (0.32s vs 47s per image)
- **Storage**: No need to cache features

**Accuracy Improvements**:
- **PASCAL VOC 2007**: 70.0% mAP (vs 66.0% for R-CNN)
- **PASCAL VOC 2012**: 68.8% mAP (vs 62.4% for R-CNN)

**Memory Efficiency**:
- **Shared Computation**: Single CNN forward pass for all proposals
- **Reduced Storage**: No intermediate feature caching required

## Faster R-CNN (2015)

### Region Proposal Networks (RPN)

**Motivation**:
Faster R-CNN addresses the remaining bottleneck in Fast R-CNN: region proposal generation. Instead of using external methods like Selective Search, it introduces the Region Proposal Network (RPN).

**RPN Architecture**:
The RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position:

$$\text{RPN}: \mathbf{F} \rightarrow \{\text{objectness scores}, \text{box coordinates}\}$$

**Anchor-Based Approach**:
At each spatial position, RPN considers $k$ anchor boxes with different scales and aspect ratios:
$$\text{Anchors}_{i,j} = \{(x_{i,j} + \Delta x_k, y_{i,j} + \Delta y_k, w_k, h_k)\}_{k=1}^K$$

where $(x_{i,j}, y_{i,j})$ is the center of spatial position $(i,j)$.

**Default Anchor Configuration**:
- **Scales**: 3 scales {$32^2, 64^2, 128^2$} pixels
- **Aspect Ratios**: 3 ratios {1:1, 1:2, 2:1}  
- **Total Anchors**: $K = 9$ at each position

### RPN Loss Function

**Multi-task RPN Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{RPN}} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{cls}}} \sum_i \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}}(p_i, p_i^*) + \lambda \frac{1}{N_{\text{reg}}} \sum_i p_i^* \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}(t_i, t_i^*)$$

where:
- $p_i$: Predicted probability of anchor $i$ being an object
- $p_i^*$: Ground truth label (1 if positive, 0 if negative)
- $t_i$: Predicted bounding box coordinates
- $t_i^*$: Ground truth bounding box coordinates

**Classification Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}}(p_i, p_i^*) = -p_i^* \log p_i - (1-p_i^*) \log(1-p_i)$$

**Regression Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}(t_i, t_i^*) = \sum_{j \in \{x,y,w,h\}} \text{smooth}_{L_1}(t_{i,j} - t_{i,j}^*)$$

**Anchor Assignment**:
- **Positive**: IoU > 0.7 with any ground truth box
- **Negative**: IoU < 0.3 with all ground truth boxes  
- **Ignore**: 0.3 ≤ IoU ≤ 0.7 (not used in loss computation)

### Four-Step Training Algorithm

**Alternating Optimization**:
Original Faster R-CNN training used alternating optimization:

**Step 1**: Train RPN
- Initialize CNN with ImageNet pre-trained weights
- Fine-tune for region proposal task
- Generated proposals used for training Fast R-CNN in next step

**Step 2**: Train Fast R-CNN  
- Use proposals from step 1
- Fine-tune CNN for detection
- This stage doesn't share convolutional layers with RPN

**Step 3**: Re-train RPN
- Initialize with CNN from step 2
- Fine-tune RPN layers only
- Shared convolutional layers are frozen

**Step 4**: Fine-tune Fast R-CNN
- Use proposals from step 3
- Fine-tune Fast R-CNN layers only
- Shared convolutional layers remain frozen

### Unified Training

**Joint End-to-End Training**:
Later implementations moved to unified training where RPN and Fast R-CNN are trained jointly:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{RPN}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Fast R-CNN}}$$

**Shared Convolutional Layers**:
Both RPN and detection head share the same convolutional feature maps:
$$\mathbf{F}_{\text{shared}} = \text{CNN}_{\text{backbone}}(I)$$

**Implementation Details**:
- **Learning Rates**: Different learning rates for different components
- **Weight Decay**: Regularization applied to all layers
- **Batch Normalization**: Applied in backbone but not in heads

### Non-Maximum Suppression in RPN

**Proposal Generation**:
After RPN inference:
1. **Score Sorting**: Sort proposals by objectness score
2. **NMS**: Apply NMS with IoU threshold (typically 0.7)
3. **Top-N Selection**: Select top N proposals (e.g., 2000 for training, 300 for inference)

**NMS Algorithm for Proposals**:
```
proposals = sort_by_score(proposals)
keep = []
while proposals is not empty:
    proposal = proposals.pop(0)  # highest score
    keep.append(proposal)
    proposals = [p for p in proposals if IoU(proposal, p) < threshold]
return keep
```

**Border Clipping**:
Proposals extending beyond image boundaries are clipped:
$$x_{\text{clipped}} = \max(0, \min(x, W-1))$$

### Feature Sharing and Computational Efficiency

**Backbone Feature Sharing**:
Both RPN and Fast R-CNN use the same backbone features, eliminating redundant computation:
- **Shared Cost**: One backbone forward pass
- **RPN Cost**: Additional lightweight conv layers
- **Fast R-CNN Cost**: RoI pooling + classification head

**Memory Efficiency**:
- **Feature Maps**: Stored once and reused
- **Proposals**: Lightweight storage (4 coordinates + score)
- **Gradient Sharing**: Backpropagation through shared layers

**Inference Speed**:
- **GPU Implementation**: ~5-17 FPS depending on backbone
- **CPU Implementation**: ~0.5 FPS  
- **Total Time**: Dominated by backbone CNN computation

### Theoretical Analysis

**Receptive Field Analysis**:
Each position in the feature map has a receptive field in the input image. For VGG-16 backbone:
- **Receptive Field Size**: ~228×228 pixels
- **Effective Stride**: 16 pixels
- **Anchor Coverage**: Anchors at different scales cover objects of different sizes

**Translation Invariance**:
RPN inherits translation invariance from its fully convolutional design:
$$\text{RPN}(\text{translate}(I, \Delta)) = \text{translate}(\text{RPN}(I), \Delta/\text{stride})$$

**Scale Handling**:
Multi-scale anchors enable handling objects at different scales:
- **Small Objects**: Detected by small anchors (32²)
- **Medium Objects**: Detected by medium anchors (64²) 
- **Large Objects**: Detected by large anchors (128²)

### Performance Analysis

**Accuracy Results**:
- **PASCAL VOC 2007**: 78.8% mAP
- **PASCAL VOC 2012**: 75.9% mAP
- **MS COCO**: 42.7% mAP

**Speed Comparison**:
| Method | Training Time | Inference Time | mAP |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| R-CNN | 84 hours | 47s | 66.0% |
| Fast R-CNN | 9.5 hours | 2.3s | 70.0% |
| Faster R-CNN | 1.5 hours | 0.2s | 78.8% |

**Ablation Studies**:
- **Anchor Scales**: More scales improve small object detection
- **Aspect Ratios**: Multiple ratios handle diverse object shapes
- **RPN vs Selective Search**: RPN significantly faster with comparable accuracy

## Advanced Components and Improvements

### Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN)

**Motivation**:
Objects appear at different scales in images. Traditional CNN features have poor resolution for small objects. FPN builds feature pyramids to handle multi-scale detection.

**Architecture**:
FPN creates a feature pyramid with both bottom-up and top-down pathways:

**Bottom-up Pathway**: Standard CNN forward pass
$$\mathbf{C}_i = \text{ConvBlock}_i(\mathbf{C}_{i-1})$$

**Top-down Pathway**: Upsampling higher-level features
$$\mathbf{M}_i = \text{Upsample}(\mathbf{M}_{i+1}) + \text{Conv}_{1x1}(\mathbf{C}_i)$$

**Lateral Connections**: Skip connections preserve fine details
$$\mathbf{P}_i = \text{Conv}_{3x3}(\mathbf{M}_i)$$

**Mathematical Framework**:
Each FPN level $P_i$ combines:
- **High-level semantics**: From top-down pathway
- **High-resolution details**: From bottom-up pathway

**RPN on FPN**:
RPN is applied to each pyramid level:
- **Different Scales**: Each level handles different object scales
- **Shared Weights**: RPN weights shared across all levels
- **Scale Assignment**: Objects assigned to levels based on area

$$k = k_0 + \log_2(\sqrt{wh}/224)$$

where $k_0 = 4$ is the base level.

### RoI Align: Addressing Quantization Issues

**Problem with RoI Pooling**:
RoI pooling introduces misalignments due to quantization:
- **Coordinate Rounding**: Loss of spatial precision  
- **Grid Quantization**: Discrete pooling regions
- **Accumulated Errors**: Compounding misalignments

**RoI Align Solution**:
RoI Align eliminates quantization by using bilinear interpolation:

**Step 1**: Divide RoI into grid without quantization
$$\text{Grid cell}_{i,j} = \left[i \frac{h}{H}, (i+1) \frac{h}{H}\right] \times \left[j \frac{w}{W}, (j+1) \frac{w}{W}\right]$$

**Step 2**: Sample points within each cell (e.g., 4 points)
**Step 3**: Bilinearly interpolate feature values at sample points  
**Step 4**: Max or average pool the interpolated values

**Bilinear Interpolation**:
For point $(x, y)$ in feature map:
$$\mathbf{f}(x,y) = \sum_{i,j} \mathbf{F}_{i,j} \cdot (1-|x-i|) \cdot (1-|y-j|) \cdot \mathbb{I}[|x-i| < 1, |y-j| < 1]$$

**Performance Impact**:
RoI Align typically improves AP by 1-2 points, especially for high IoU thresholds.

### Mask R-CNN: Extension to Instance Segmentation

**Architecture Extension**:
Mask R-CNN adds a mask prediction branch to Faster R-CNN:
$$\text{Outputs} = \{\text{class}, \text{box}, \text{mask}\}$$

**Mask Branch**:
- **FCN Structure**: Fully convolutional for pixel-wise prediction
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution than classification/regression branches
- **Loss**: Binary cross-entropy for each class

**Multi-task Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{box}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{mask}}$$

**Mask Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{mask}} = -\frac{1}{m^2} \sum_{1 \leq i,j \leq m} [y_{ij} \log \hat{y}_{ij}^{k} + (1-y_{ij}) \log(1-\hat{y}_{ij}^{k})]$$

where $k$ is the ground truth class, $m×m$ is mask resolution.

## Training Strategies and Optimization

### Data Augmentation for Detection

**Image-level Augmentations**:
- **Horizontal Flipping**: 50% probability
- **Scale Jittering**: Randomly resize within range
- **Color Jittering**: Random brightness, contrast, saturation

**Box-aware Augmentations**:
Traditional augmentations must preserve spatial relationships:
$$\text{Augmented boxes} = \text{Transform}(\text{original boxes}, \text{image transform})$$

**Specialized Detection Augmentations**:
- **Mixup**: Blend images and corresponding labels
- **Cutmix**: Replace image regions with patches from other images
- **Mosaic**: Combine 4 images in a 2×2 grid

### Hard Negative Mining

**Problem**: Class imbalance between objects and background
**Solution**: Focus training on hard negative examples

**Online Hard Negative Mining (OHEM)**:
1. Forward pass through all RoIs
2. Sort RoIs by loss value  
3. Select top-K hard negatives for backward pass
4. Update weights using only hard examples

**Mathematical Formulation**:
$$\text{Hard Negatives} = \arg\max_{K} \{\mathcal{L}(r_i) : r_i \in \text{Negative RoIs}\}$$

**Focal Loss Alternative**:
Instead of hard negative mining, use focal loss to automatically down-weight easy examples:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{focal}} = -\alpha (1-p_t)^\gamma \log p_t$$

### Multi-Scale Training and Testing

**Multi-Scale Training**:
- **Image Pyramid**: Train on images at multiple scales
- **Random Scale**: Randomly sample scale for each image
- **Scale Ranges**: Typical range [480, 800] pixels

**Multi-Scale Testing**:
- **Test Time Augmentation**: Apply model to multiple scales
- **Result Fusion**: Combine detections across scales using NMS
- **Performance Trade-off**: Accuracy improvement vs computational cost

**Implementation Details**:
```python
scales = [480, 512, 544, 576, 608, 640, 672, 704, 736, 768, 800]
for scale in scales:
    resized_image = resize(image, scale)
    detections = model(resized_image)
    all_detections.append(detections)
final_detections = multi_scale_nms(all_detections)
```

## Evaluation Metrics and Analysis

### Mean Average Precision (mAP) Analysis

**Detection Evaluation Complexity**:
Unlike classification, detection evaluation requires matching predictions to ground truth objects across different IoU thresholds.

**Matching Algorithm**:
For each class and IoU threshold:
1. Sort detections by confidence score
2. For each detection, find best matching ground truth
3. Mark matches above IoU threshold as true positives
4. Compute precision-recall curve
5. Calculate average precision

**COCO Evaluation Metrics**:
- **AP**: Average over IoU thresholds 0.5:0.05:0.95
- **AP₅₀**: AP at IoU threshold 0.5  
- **AP₇₅**: AP at IoU threshold 0.75
- **APₛ, APₘ, APₗ**: AP for small, medium, large objects

**Error Analysis Framework**:
Common error types in two-stage detectors:
- **Localization Errors**: Correct class, poor bounding box
- **Background Confusion**: False positives on background
- **Class Confusion**: Confusion between similar classes
- **Missed Detections**: Objects not detected (recall errors)

## Computational Complexity and Optimization

### FLOPs Analysis

**Faster R-CNN Computational Breakdown**:
1. **Backbone CNN**: $O(H \times W \times D)$ for feature extraction
2. **RPN**: $O(H' \times W' \times K)$ for proposal generation  
3. **RoI Pooling**: $O(N \times 7 \times 7)$ for feature extraction
4. **Detection Head**: $O(N \times D)$ for classification and regression

where $H', W'$ are feature map dimensions, $K$ is number of anchors, $N$ is number of proposals.

**Memory Requirements**:
- **Backbone Features**: $H' \times W' \times D \times 4$ bytes
- **RPN Proposals**: $N \times 5 \times 4$ bytes (4 coords + score)
- **RoI Features**: $N \times 7 \times 7 \times D \times 4$ bytes
- **Gradients**: Additional 2× memory during training

### Inference Optimization

**Model Quantization**:
Reduce precision from FP32 to INT8 or FP16:
- **Post-training Quantization**: Convert trained model
- **Quantization-aware Training**: Simulate quantization during training
- **Performance**: 2-4× speedup with minimal accuracy loss

**Model Pruning**:
Remove redundant weights or filters:
- **Weight Pruning**: Remove small magnitude weights
- **Filter Pruning**: Remove entire filters
- **Structured vs Unstructured**: Trade-off between speedup and accuracy

**Knowledge Distillation**:
Train smaller student model to mimic larger teacher:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}} + (1-\alpha) \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}$ is KL divergence between student and teacher predictions.
