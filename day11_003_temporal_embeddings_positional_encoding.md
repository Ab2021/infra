## 1. Foundations of Temporal Encoding

### 1.1 The Temporal Information Challenge

**Why Temporal Encoding Matters**

Sequential recommendation systems must capture not just what users have interacted with, but when these interactions occurred:

**Types of Temporal Information**
- **Absolute Time**: Exact timestamps of interactions (e.g., "2024-01-15 14:30:00")
- **Relative Time**: Time differences between interactions (e.g., "2 hours after previous interaction")
- **Cyclical Time**: Recurring patterns (e.g., hour of day, day of week, season)
- **Ordinal Position**: Sequential order within sessions or user histories

**Temporal Patterns in User Behavior**
- **Recency Effects**: More recent interactions are often more influential
- **Periodicity**: Daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns in user behavior
- **Decay Functions**: Influence of past interactions decreases over time
- **Event-Driven Behavior**: Specific events that trigger behavior changes

**Challenges in Temporal Modeling**
- **Scale Variations**: From milliseconds to years in temporal ranges
- **Missing Timestamps**: Incomplete or noisy temporal information
- **Irregular Intervals**: Non-uniform time gaps between interactions
- **Multiple Time Scales**: Simultaneous patterns at different temporal granularities

### 1.2 Temporal Information Representation

**Continuous vs Discrete Time**

**Continuous Time Representation**
- **Real-Valued Timestamps**: Use actual time values as features
- **Time Differences**: Encode intervals between consecutive interactions
- **Smooth Interpolation**: Continuous functions for temporal effects

### 1.3 Temporal Feature Engineering
