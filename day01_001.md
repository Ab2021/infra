## Introduction

Search and Recommendation Systems represent one of the most impactful applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence in modern digital ecosystems. These systems fundamentally solve the **information discovery problem** - helping users find relevant content, products, or information from vast collections of data.

### Core Definitions

**Search Systems**: Information retrieval systems that respond to explicit user queries by returning ranked lists of relevant documents, products, or content.

**Recommendation Systems**: Proactive filtering systems that predict and suggest items of interest to users based on their preferences, behavior, and contextual factors.

### The Information Overload Problem

The exponential growth of digital content has created what Herbert Simon termed "information overload." Consider these statistics:
- Google processes over 8.5 billion searches daily
- YouTube uploads 500 hours of video every minute
- Amazon has over 350 million products

This scale necessitates intelligent systems that can:
1. **Filter** irrelevant information
2. **Rank** results by relevance/preference
3. **Personalize** based on user context
4. **Scale** to billions of users and items

## Historical Evolution: From Classical IR to GenAI

### Phase 1: Classical Information Retrieval (1960s-1990s)

#### Boolean Search Models
The earliest search systems relied on **Boolean logic** for exact matching:
- **AND**: Documents must contain all terms
- **OR**: Documents must contain at least one term  
- **NOT**: Documents must not contain specified terms

**Limitations**: No ranking, binary relevance, query complexity

#### TF-IDF Revolution (1970s-1980s)
**Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency** introduced the concept of weighted relevance:

```
TF-IDF(t,d,D) = TF(t,d) × IDF(t,D)
where:
TF(t,d) = f(t,d) / |d|  (term frequency)
IDF(t,D) = log(|D| / |{d ∈ D : t ∈ d}|)  (inverse document frequency)
```

**Key Insight**: Common terms (high document frequency) are less discriminative than rare terms.

#### BM25 Enhancement (1990s)
**Best Matching 25** improved upon TF-IDF with term saturation:

```
BM25(t,d,D) = IDF(t,D) × (f(t,d) × (k₁ + 1)) / (f(t,d) + k₁ × (1 - b + b × |d|/avgdl))
```

**Parameters**:
- k₁: Controls term frequency saturation (typically 1.2-2.0)
- b: Controls document length normalization (typically 0.75)

### Phase 2: Collaborative Filtering Era (1990s-2000s)

#### Memory-Based Approaches
**User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: 
- Find users with similar preferences
- Recommend items liked by similar users
- Similarity metrics: Pearson correlation, Cosine similarity

**Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**:
- Find items similar to those the user has liked
- More stable than user-based due to item relationship persistence

#### Model-Based Approaches
**Matrix Factorization** techniques like **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**:
- Decompose user-item interaction matrix R into lower-dimensional matrices
- R ≈ U × Σ × V^T
- Capture latent factors representing user preferences and item characteristics

### Phase 3: Machine Learning Integration (2000s-2010s)

#### Learning to Rank (LTR)
Transformed ranking from heuristic-based to data-driven approaches:

**Pointwise**: Predict relevance score for each document independently
**Pairwise**: Learn relative preferences between document pairs
**Listwise**: Optimize entire ranking list quality

#### Deep Learning Revolution (2010s)
**Neural Collaborative Filtering**: Replace inner product with neural networks
**Autoencoders**: Learn compressed user/item representations
**RNNs**: Model sequential user behavior

### Phase 4: Transformer and Attention Era (2017-2020)

#### BERT for Search
**Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers** revolutionized query understanding:
- **Context-aware embeddings**: Same word, different meanings based on context
- **Bidirectional attention**: Consider both left and right context
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapt pre-trained models for specific search tasks

#### Attention Mechanisms in Recommendations
**Self-attention** enables models to focus on relevant parts of user history:
- Identify which past interactions are most relevant for current prediction
- Handle variable-length sequences naturally
- Capture long-range dependencies

### Phase 5: Large Language Models and GenAI Era (2020-Present)

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Combines dense retrieval with generative capabilities:
1. **Retrieve** relevant documents using vector similarity
2. **Augment** prompt with retrieved context
3. **Generate** contextually informed responses

#### Vector Search Revolution
**Dense retrieval** using pre-trained language models:
- Convert queries and documents to dense vector representations
- Use semantic similarity instead of lexical matching
- Enable cross-lingual and cross-modal search

## Theoretical Foundations

### Information Theory Perspective
Search and recommendation can be viewed through **information theory**:
- **Entropy**: Measure of uncertainty in user intent
- **Mutual Information**: Shared information between query and document
- **KL Divergence**: Measure relevance as distribution similarity

### Probability Theory Framework
**Probability Ranking Principle**: Rank documents by probability of relevance
```
P(relevant|query, document) = P(query|document, relevant) × P(relevant|document) / P(query)
```

### Learning Theory Considerations
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Balance between model complexity and generalization
- **No Free Lunch Theorem**: No universally best algorithm for all problems
- **Cold Start Problem**: Bootstrapping recommendations for new users/items

## Code Examples

### TF-IDF Implementation
```python
import math
from collections import Counter

def compute_tf_idf(documents, query_terms):
    # Compute term frequencies
    doc_tfs = []
    for doc in documents:
        tf = Counter(doc.lower().split())
        doc_tfs.append(tf)
    
    # Compute document frequencies
    doc_freq = Counter()
    for tf in doc_tfs:
        doc_freq.update(tf.keys())
    
    # Compute TF-IDF scores
    scores = []
    N = len(documents)
    
    for i, tf in enumerate(doc_tfs):
        score = 0
        for term in query_terms:
            if term in tf:
                tf_score = tf[term] / sum(tf.values())
                idf_score = math.log(N / doc_freq[term])
                score += tf_score * idf_score
        scores.append(score)
    
    return scores
```

### Simple Collaborative Filtering
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

def user_based_cf(user_item_matrix, target_user, k=5):
    # Compute user similarities
    similarities = []
    target_vector = user_item_matrix[target_user]
    
    for i, user_vector in enumerate(user_item_matrix):
        if i != target_user:
            sim = 1 - cosine(target_vector, user_vector)
            similarities.append((i, sim))
    
    # Get top-k similar users
    similarities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    top_k_users = similarities[:k]
    
    # Generate recommendations
    recommendations = {}
    for user_id, similarity in top_k_users:
        user_ratings = user_item_matrix[user_id]
        for item_id, rating in enumerate(user_ratings):
            if rating > 0 and target_vector[item_id] == 0:  # Item not rated by target
                if item_id not in recommendations:
                    recommendations[item_id] = 0
                recommendations[item_id] += similarity * rating
    
    return sorted(recommendations.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```
