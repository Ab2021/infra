### Computational Graph Partitioning

#### Graph Partitioning Fundamentals
**Mathematical Framework**:
```
Computational Graph G = (V, E) where:
V = {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} (operations/tensors)
E = {(vᵢ, vⱼ)} (data dependencies)

Device Assignment Function:
π: V → D where D = {device₁, device₂, ..., deviceₖ}

Optimization Objective:

subject to: Memory_Constraint(deviceᵢ) ∀i ∈ D
```

**Partitioning Complexity Analysis**:
```
Problem Classification:

- Approximation algorithms for practical solutions

Partitioning Quality Metrics:
1. Load Balance: max(load) / avg(load)
2. Communication Volume: Σ edge_weights across partitions
3. Memory Utilization: max(memory_usage) / available_memory

Multi-objective Optimization:
Pareto-optimal solutions balance computation, communication, memory
```

#### Placement Strategies

**Static Placement Algorithms**:
```
Greedy Assignment:
1. Topologically sort computational graph
2. For each operation in order:
   - Evaluate placement cost on each device
   - Assign to device with minimum cost
3. Cost includes: computation time + communication overhead

Min-Cut Partitioning:
- Model as graph partitioning problem
- Minimize inter-partition edge weights
- Use algorithms: Kernighan-Lin, Fiduccia-Mattheyses, METIS

Mathematical Formulation:
minimize: Σ_{(u,v)∈E, π(u)≠π(v)} weight(u,v)
subject to: |partition_i| ≤ (1+ε) × N/k ∀i (balance constraint)
```

## 🔄 Multi-GPU Parallelism Patterns

### Data Parallelism Theory

#### Synchronous Data Parallelism
**Mathematical Framework**:
```
Data Parallel Training:
- Split batch B into sub-batches: B = B₁ ∪ B₂ ∪ ... ∪ Bₖ
- Each GPU computes: ∇θᵢ = (1/|Bᵢ|) Σ_{x∈Bᵢ} ∇L(x, θ)
- Aggregate gradients: ∇θ = (1/k) Σᵢ ∇θᵢ
- Update parameters: θ ← θ - η∇θ

Convergence Analysis:
E[||∇L||²] ≤ O(1/T) + O(variance_reduction_factor)
Variance reduction depends on batch size and gradient correlation
```

**Scaling Efficiency Analysis**:
```
Ideal Speedup: S = N (number of GPUs)
Actual Speedup: S_actual = N / (1 + communication_overhead_fraction)

Communication Overhead Sources:
1. AllReduce communication: O(P) for P parameters
2. Synchronization barriers: Fixed cost per iteration
3. Load imbalance: max(local_time) - avg(local_time)

Efficiency = S_actual / N
Target efficiency > 80% for good scaling
```

#### Asynchronous Data Parallelism
**Parameter Server Architecture**:
```
Components:
- Parameter servers: Store and update global parameters
- Worker nodes: Compute gradients on local data
- Asynchronous updates: No global synchronization

Update Protocol:
1. Worker pulls parameters: θ_local ← θ_global
2. Compute local gradients: ∇θ_local = gradient(batch)
3. Push gradients: θ_global ← θ_global - η∇θ_local

Staleness Analysis:
τ = staleness (age of parameters used)
Convergence rate: O(1/T + τ/T) where τ << T for convergence
```

**Federated Averaging Theory**:
```
FedAvg Algorithm:
1. Server sends global model to selected clients
2. Clients perform local updates for E epochs
3. Server aggregates client updates

Mathematical Analysis:
Global_Update = Σᵢ (nᵢ/n) × Client_Update_i
where nᵢ = local data size, n = total data size

Convergence Bounds:
Communication rounds required: O(1/ε²) for ε-accurate solution
Depends on data heterogeneity and local update frequency
```

### Model Parallelism Theory

#### Pipeline Parallelism
**Pipeline Scheduling Theory**:
```
Forward-Backward Pipeline:
Stage 1: F₁ → B₁ → F₁ → B₁ → ...
Stage 2:    → F₂ → B₂ → F₂ → B₂ → ...
Stage k:         → ... → Fₖ → Bₖ → ...

Pipeline Efficiency:
Ideal_Time = k × (Forward_Time + Backward_Time)
Actual_Time = Pipeline_Fill_Time + Steady_State_Time + Pipeline_Drain_Time

Efficiency = Ideal_Time / Actual_Time
```

**Gradient Accumulation Mathematics**:
```
Micro-batch Gradient Accumulation:
Split logical batch into micro-batches for pipeline stages
Accumulate gradients across micro-batches

Mathematical Equivalence:
∇θ_pipeline = (1/M) Σᵢ ∇θ_micro_i
where M = number of micro-batches

Memory vs Computation Trade-off:
Smaller micro-batches → less memory per stage
More micro-batches → more pipeline bubbles
Optimal micro-batch size balances these factors
```

#### Tensor Parallelism
**Matrix Partitioning Strategies**:
```
Row Partitioning: A = [A₁; A₂; ...; Aₖ]
Column Partitioning: A = [A₁ | A₂ | ... | Aₖ]

For Y = XW:
Row partition W: Each GPU computes partial result, AllReduce sum
Column partition W: Split computation, AllGather results

Communication Analysis:
Row partition: AllReduce of output (size = batch × output_dim)
Column partition: AllGather of output (size = batch × output_dim)
Same communication volume, different patterns
```

**Attention Mechanism Parallelism**:
```
Multi-Head Attention Parallelism:
Distribute attention heads across GPUs
Each GPU: Attention_head_i = Attention(Q_i, K_i, V_i)
Concatenate results: MultiHead = Concat(head₁, head₂, ..., headₖ)

Communication Requirements:
- Input broadcast: Q, K, V to all GPUs
- Output concatenation: Gather results from all GPUs
- Memory scaling: O(sequence_length²/num_gpus) per GPU
```

### Hybrid Parallelism Strategies

#### 3D Parallelism Framework
**Parallelism Dimensions**:
```
3D Parallelism = Data × Model × Pipeline
Total GPUs: N = N_data × N_model × N_pipeline

Resource Allocation:
Each dimension reduces different bottlenecks:
- Data parallelism: Batch size scaling
- Model parallelism: Model size scaling  
- Pipeline parallelism: Memory efficiency

Optimization Problem:
Choose (N_data, N_model, N_pipeline) to minimize training time
Subject to: N_data × N_model × N_pipeline = N_total
```

**Communication Pattern Analysis**:
```
Communication Requirements:
Data Parallel: AllReduce gradients (within data parallel group)
Model Parallel: AllReduce/AllGather within model parallel group
Pipeline Parallel: Point-to-point between adjacent stages

Total Communication Volume:
Volume = Data_Parallel_Volume + Model_Parallel_Volume
Overlap opportunities reduce effective communication time
```

### Network Topology Analysis

#### Bandwidth and Bisection Analysis
**Network Topology Metrics**:
```
Key Metrics:
1. Bisection Bandwidth: Minimum bandwidth when network split in half
2. Diameter: Maximum shortest path between any two nodes
3. Degree: Number of connections per node
4. Fault Tolerance: Number of failures network can tolerate

Common Topologies:
Topology        Bisection BW    Diameter    Degree    Fault Tolerance
Ring            1 link          N/2         2         Low
Mesh 2D         √N links        2(√N-1)     2-4       Medium
Torus 2D        2√N links       √N          4         Medium
Hypercube       N/2 links       log N       log N     High
Fat Tree        Full BW         2 log N     Variable  High
```

**All-Reduce Algorithm Analysis**:
```
Ring All-Reduce:
Time Complexity: O(N) where N = number of nodes
Bandwidth Optimal: Uses full bisection bandwidth
Algorithm: 2(N-1) communication steps

Recursive Halving:

- Tree AllReduce: Best for low-latency networks
- Hierarchical: Best for multi-level topologies (NUMA, multi-node)

Performance Model:
AllReduce_Time = α × log(P) + β × (P-1)/P × M
where:
α = latency per hop
β = inverse bandwidth  
P = number of processes
M = message size

Optimization: Choose algorithm minimizing total time
```

**Bandwidth Aggregation Strategies**:
```
Multi-Path Communication:
- Stripe large messages across multiple paths
- Increases effective bandwidth utilization
- Requires careful routing to avoid congestion

Load Balancing:
Distribute communication across available links
Monitor link utilization and adapt routing
Mathematical model: min-max link utilization
```

### Communication Overlap Techniques

#### Computation-Communication Overlap
**Overlap Strategies**:
```
Gradient Bucketing:
- Divide gradients into buckets by dependency order
- Start communication as soon as bucket gradients ready
- Overlap backward pass with gradient communication

Mathematical Analysis:
Overlap_Efficiency = Overlapped_Time / Total_Communication_Time
Perfect overlap: computation completely hides communication
Practical overlap: 60-90% typical for well-tuned systems
```

**Asynchronous Communication**:
```
Non-blocking Communication Primitives:
- Initiate communication without waiting for completion
- Continue computation while communication in progress
- Synchronize when communication results needed

Pipeline Efficiency:
T_pipeline = max(T_computation, T_communication)
vs
T_sequential = T_computation + T_communication

Speedup = T_sequential / T_pipeline ≤ 1 + T_communication/T_computation
```

## 🎯 Advanced Understanding Questions

### Device Placement and Optimization:
1. **Q**: Analyze the computational complexity of optimal device placement for arbitrary computational graphs and propose practical approximation algorithms.
   **A**: Optimal placement is NP-hard (reduction from graph partitioning). Practical algorithms: greedy O(V log V), simulated annealing O(V²), genetic algorithms. Approximation ratios: 2-4× optimal for most practical cases. Key insight: use graph structure (DAG properties) and communication locality for better heuristics.

2. **Q**: Derive mathematical models for communication cost in different network topologies and analyze their impact on multi-GPU scaling efficiency.
   **A**: Communication cost = α·log(P) + β·M·(P-1)/P for tree reduction, α·2(P-1) + β·M for ring. Scaling efficiency = T_sequential/(T_parallel + T_communication). Ring better for bandwidth-bound, tree better for latency-bound. Crossover point depends on message size and network characteristics.

3. **Q**: Compare static vs dynamic device placement strategies and analyze their convergence properties and computational overhead.
   **A**: Static: O(V log V) preprocessing, no runtime overhead, suboptimal for dynamic workloads. Dynamic: O(1) per decision, adaptation capability, potential oscillation. Convergence analysis requires game theory for multi-agent scenarios. Hybrid approaches balance optimization quality with computational cost.

### Multi-GPU Parallelism:
4. **Q**: Analyze the theoretical scaling limits of different parallelism strategies and derive conditions for optimal parallelism combination.
   **A**: Data parallelism: limited by communication/computation ratio O(P/B) where P=parameters, B=batch size. Model parallelism: limited by critical path and load balance. Pipeline: limited by bubble overhead. Optimal combination: solve multi-dimensional optimization problem with communication constraints.

5. **Q**: Develop a mathematical framework for analyzing gradient synchronization strategies in distributed training and their impact on convergence.
   **A**: Synchronous: E[||∇L||²] ≤ O(1/T), requires barrier synchronization. Asynchronous: additional staleness term O(τ/T). Optimal synchronization frequency balances convergence speed vs communication overhead. Framework includes variance reduction analysis and communication complexity bounds.

6. **Q**: Compare the memory and communication trade-offs of different model parallelism strategies for transformer architectures.
   **A**: Tensor parallelism: O(H²/P) memory per GPU, O(H·B) communication per layer. Pipeline parallelism: O(H²·L/P) memory, O(H·B) communication per micro-batch. Memory-communication Pareto frontier depends on model size, batch size, and network bandwidth.

### Communication and Load Balancing:
7. **Q**: Design and analyze a network-topology-aware communication algorithm that adapts to changing network conditions and hardware failures.
   **A**: Algorithm: maintain network topology graph, use shortest-path routing with bandwidth weights, adapt to congestion through feedback control. Analysis: competitive ratio vs optimal routing, fault tolerance through alternative path discovery, convergence time for adaptation. Include congestion control theory and distributed routing protocols.

8. **Q**: Propose a comprehensive fault tolerance framework for distributed GPU training that handles different failure modes and analyze its overhead characteristics.
   **A**: Framework: hierarchical checkpointing (local + global), algorithm-based fault tolerance for computation errors, dynamic resource allocation for hardware failures. Overhead analysis: checkpointing O(memory_size/bandwidth), detection O(computation_overhead), recovery O(checkpoint_size + replay_time). Trade-offs between fault tolerance coverage and performance impact.
