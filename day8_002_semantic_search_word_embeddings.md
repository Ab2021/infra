# Day 8.2: Semantic Search using Word Embeddings

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
- Understand the evolution from lexical to semantic search
- Analyze different word embedding techniques and their applications
- Evaluate the strengths and limitations of various embedding models
- Design semantic search systems using embedding-based approaches
- Understand the role of context in semantic similarity
- Apply embedding techniques for query-document matching

## 1. From Lexical to Semantic Search

### 1.1 Limitations of Traditional Lexical Search

**The Vocabulary Mismatch Problem**

Traditional search systems rely on exact or approximate string matching, which creates several fundamental limitations:

**Synonymy Problem**
- Users and documents may use different words to express the same concept
- Example: "car" vs "automobile" vs "vehicle"
- Traditional systems fail to match semantically equivalent terms
- Results in reduced recall and missed relevant documents

**Polysemy Problem**
- Words can have multiple meanings depending on context
- Example: "bank" (financial institution vs river bank)
- Traditional systems cannot disambiguate word meanings
- Results in irrelevant results and reduced precision

**Morphological Variations**
- Different word forms express the same concept
- Example: "run", "running", "ran", "runner"
- Stemming and lemmatization provide partial solutions
- Complex morphology in some languages remains challenging

**Conceptual Gaps**
- Related concepts may not share common vocabulary
- Example: "Python programming" and "software development"
- Traditional systems miss conceptual relationships
- Limits discovery of relevant but differently expressed content

### 1.2 The Promise of Semantic Search

**Semantic Understanding Benefits**

## 2. Word2Vec and Distributional Semantics

### 2.1 Theoretical Foundations

**Distributional Hypothesis**

The foundational principle underlying modern word embeddings:
*"Words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings"*

**Key Insights**
