## AI/ML Threat Modeling Fundamentals

### Understanding AI/ML Threat Landscapes

**Unique Characteristics of AI/ML Threats:**

AI/ML threat modeling requires fundamentally different approaches compared to traditional software security assessment because machine learning systems present novel attack surfaces, unique vulnerabilities, and complex interdependencies that do not exist in conventional computing environments. The probabilistic nature of AI/ML systems, their dependence on training data quality, and their potential for subtle manipulation create threat profiles that require specialized analysis frameworks and expertise.

Traditional threat modeling approaches focus primarily on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad violations through conventional attack vectors such as unauthorized access, data modification, and service disruption. AI/ML threat modeling must extend this foundation to include model-specific threats such as adversarial manipulation that causes misclassification without traditional system compromise, data poisoning that subtly influences model behavior through malicious training examples, model extraction that steals intellectual property through systematic querying, and privacy attacks that extract sensitive information about training data or individuals.

The temporal complexity of AI/ML threats adds another dimension to threat modeling because attacks may be implemented during training phases but only manifest during production inference, or may require extended periods of data collection and analysis to execute successfully. This temporal separation between attack implementation and manifestation requires threat models that can account for long-term attack campaigns and delayed impact scenarios.

**Stakeholder Impact Analysis:**

AI/ML threat modeling must consider impacts on diverse stakeholder communities that may be affected differently by various types of attacks and security incidents. These stakeholders include individuals whose personal data may be used in training or who may be affected by AI/ML system decisions, organizations that develop, deploy, or rely on AI/ML systems for business operations, regulatory authorities that oversee AI/ML system compliance and safety, and society at large that may be affected by widespread AI/ML system failures or manipulation.

Individual stakeholder impacts may include privacy violations through unauthorized exposure of personal information, discriminatory treatment due to biased or manipulated AI/ML systems, economic harm from incorrect AI/ML decisions affecting employment, credit, or services, and autonomy reduction through over-reliance on automated AI/ML systems for critical decisions.

Organizational stakeholder impacts may include financial losses from AI/ML system failures or attacks, competitive disadvantage from intellectual property theft or model extraction, regulatory sanctions and legal liability from compliance violations or discriminatory outcomes, and reputational damage from publicized AI/ML security incidents or ethical concerns.

Societal stakeholder impacts may include erosion of trust in AI/ML systems and automated decision-making, exacerbation of social inequalities through biased or manipulated AI/ML systems, systemic risks from widespread adoption of vulnerable AI/ML architectures, and reduced human agency and oversight in critical decision-making processes.

**Risk Assessment Integration:**

AI/ML threat modeling must integrate closely with organizational risk assessment processes to ensure that identified threats are properly prioritized and addressed within broader risk management frameworks. This integration requires translation of technical threat information into business risk language while maintaining sufficient technical detail to support effective mitigation planning.

Threat likelihood assessment for AI/ML systems must consider factors such as the technical sophistication required to execute different types of attacks, the availability of tools and techniques for implementing AI/ML attacks, the attractiveness of specific AI/ML targets to different threat actor types, and the current threat landscape and observed attack trends in AI/ML environments.

Impact assessment for AI/ML threats must evaluate potential consequences across multiple dimensions including immediate technical impacts such as system failures or performance degradation, business impacts such as service disruption or competitive disadvantage, regulatory impacts such as compliance violations or enforcement actions, and strategic impacts such as reputational damage or market position erosion.

### Threat Modeling Methodologies

**STRIDE-ML Framework:**

The STRIDE-ML framework extends the traditional STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) threat modeling methodology to address AI/ML-specific threats while maintaining compatibility with existing threat modeling processes and tools. This extended framework provides systematic approaches for identifying AI/ML threats while leveraging established threat modeling expertise and organizational familiarity.

Spoofing in AI/ML contexts may include adversarial examples that spoof legitimate inputs to cause misclassification, synthetic data generation that creates fake training examples or individuals, model impersonation where attackers substitute malicious models for legitimate ones, and identity spoofing in federated learning or collaborative AI/ML scenarios.

Tampering threats for AI/ML systems may involve training data poisoning that introduces malicious examples into datasets, model parameter manipulation that alters model behavior through direct modification, gradient manipulation in distributed training scenarios, and hyperparameter tampering that affects model training and performance.

Information Disclosure in AI/ML environments may include model inversion attacks that extract sensitive training data information, membership inference attacks that determine whether specific individuals were included in training data, model extraction attacks that steal proprietary model functionality or parameters, and unintended information leakage through model predictions or explanations.

**PASTA-ML Methodology:**

The Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis for Machine Learning (PASTA-ML) provides a risk-centric threat modeling approach specifically designed for AI/ML systems. This methodology emphasizes business risk alignment while providing systematic processes for AI/ML threat identification, analysis, and mitigation planning.

Business objective analysis in PASTA-ML focuses on understanding how AI/ML systems support organizational goals while identifying critical success factors and potential failure modes. This analysis must consider both direct AI/ML system objectives such as prediction accuracy and performance, and broader business objectives such as customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and competitive advantage.

Technical architecture analysis in PASTA-ML examines AI/ML system components and their interactions while identifying potential attack surfaces and vulnerability points. This analysis must account for the distributed nature of many AI/ML deployments, the complex data flows between different system components, and the specialized hardware and software requirements of AI/ML operations.

Attack scenario development in PASTA-ML creates detailed attack narratives that describe how specific threats might be realized against AI/ML systems while considering attacker capabilities, motivations, and constraints. These scenarios must account for both conventional cyber attacks targeting AI/ML infrastructure and specialized AI/ML attacks targeting model behavior and training data.

**DREAD-ML Assessment:**

The DREAD-ML assessment framework adapts the traditional DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability) risk rating system to provide AI/ML-specific threat prioritization capabilities. This framework enables organizations to systematically evaluate and compare different AI/ML threats while making informed decisions about mitigation investments.

Damage assessment for AI/ML threats must consider multiple impact categories including technical damage such as model performance degradation or system availability loss, business damage such as revenue loss or competitive disadvantage, compliance damage such as regulatory violations or legal liability, and reputational damage such as public criticism or stakeholder confidence erosion.

Reproducibility evaluation for AI/ML threats must consider the consistency and reliability of different attack techniques while accounting for factors such as model architecture dependencies, data quality requirements, environmental conditions, and attacker skill requirements that may affect attack success rates.

Exploitability assessment must evaluate the technical difficulty and resource requirements for implementing different types of AI/ML attacks while considering factors such as required access levels, specialized knowledge requirements, tool availability, and detection difficulty that may affect attack feasibility.

## Attack Surface Analysis

### AI/ML System Components

**Model Serving Infrastructure:**

Model serving infrastructure represents a critical attack surface for AI/ML systems because it provides the primary interface through which external users and systems interact with trained models. This infrastructure must handle potentially large volumes of inference requests while maintaining security controls, performance requirements, and availability commitments that make it an attractive target for various types of attacks.

API endpoints for model inference present multiple attack vectors including input validation vulnerabilities that may allow adversarial examples or malicious payloads, authentication and authorization bypasses that enable unauthorized model access, rate limiting failures that allow resource exhaustion or denial of service attacks, and output manipulation that could modify or suppress legitimate model predictions.

Load balancing and scaling infrastructure for model serving creates additional attack surfaces including configuration vulnerabilities in load balancers and auto-scaling systems, session management issues that could enable session hijacking or fixation attacks, health check manipulation that could cause inappropriate failover or scaling decisions, and monitoring system compromise that could hide malicious activities or enable reconnaissance.

Model artifact storage and retrieval systems require protection against unauthorized access, modification, or exfiltration while supporting the operational requirements of model serving infrastructure. Attack vectors may include storage access control bypasses, model versioning system manipulation, artifact integrity verification failures, and backup and recovery system compromise.

**Training Infrastructure:**

Training infrastructure presents complex attack surfaces because it typically involves distributed computing resources, large-scale data processing, and extended execution times that create multiple opportunities for attack implementation and persistence. The high value of training resources and proprietary algorithms makes this infrastructure an attractive target for resource theft, intellectual property espionage, and sabotage activities.

Distributed training systems create attack surfaces through inter-node communication channels that may lack appropriate authentication or encryption, parameter synchronization mechanisms that could be manipulated to influence model convergence, resource allocation systems that could be abused for denial of service or resource theft, and checkpoint and state management systems that could be targeted for persistence or data exfiltration.

Training data access controls must protect against unauthorized data access while supporting the operational requirements of training workflows. Attack vectors may include data source authentication bypasses, data transformation pipeline manipulation, feature engineering process compromise, and training data versioning system exploitation.

Experiment tracking and model development platforms create additional attack surfaces through user authentication and authorization systems, experiment metadata and artifact storage, code repository integration, and collaboration and sharing features that could be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

**Data Management Systems:**

Data management systems for AI/ML environments must handle diverse data types, large data volumes, and complex data lineage requirements while maintaining security controls and compliance with privacy and protection regulations. These systems represent high-value targets because they contain the training data that is essential for AI/ML system functionality and may include sensitive personal or business information.

Data lake and warehouse systems present attack surfaces through access control mechanisms that may not provide appropriate granularity for AI/ML use cases, data catalog systems that could be manipulated to hide or misdirect data access, data transformation and ETL pipeline systems that could be compromised to introduce malicious data, and data retention and deletion systems that could be exploited to prevent required data removal or retention.

Feature stores and data preprocessing systems create additional attack surfaces through feature computation logic that could be manipulated to affect model training, feature metadata systems that could be altered to cause incorrect feature usage, data validation systems that could be bypassed to introduce low-quality or malicious data, and caching systems that could be poisoned to affect multiple AI/ML workflows.

Data governance and compliance systems must protect sensitive data while supporting AI/ML operational requirements. Attack vectors may include data classification system manipulation, privacy control bypasses, audit log tampering, and compliance reporting system compromise that could hide violations or create false compliance evidence.

### Network Attack Surfaces

**East-West Traffic Analysis:**

East-west traffic analysis for AI/ML environments must account for the complex communication patterns between different AI/ML system components including data flows between storage and processing systems, model synchronization traffic in distributed training scenarios, API communications between microservices, and monitoring and logging traffic that provides operational visibility.

Inter-service communication in AI/ML architectures often involves high-volume data transfers that may be difficult to monitor comprehensively while maintaining performance requirements. Attack vectors may include man-in-the-middle attacks on unencrypted communications, traffic analysis that reveals sensitive information about model architectures or data characteristics, injection attacks through API communications, and replay attacks that could cause unintended model training or inference activities.

Container and orchestration platform communications create additional attack surfaces through container-to-container networking that may lack appropriate access controls, service discovery mechanisms that could be manipulated to redirect traffic, secrets management systems that protect API keys and certificates, and network policy enforcement that controls traffic flows between different system components.

Cloud provider internal networking presents attack surfaces through virtual network configuration errors, security group misconfigurations that allow inappropriate access, network access control list bypasses, and cloud service integration points that could be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

**External Interface Security:**

External interfaces for AI/ML systems must balance accessibility requirements with security controls while supporting various types of users and use cases. These interfaces represent primary attack vectors because they are accessible to external attackers while providing access to valuable AI/ML capabilities and data.

Web application interfaces for AI/ML systems present traditional web application attack vectors including cross-site scripting that could steal user credentials or session tokens, SQL injection attacks targeting backend databases, cross-site request forgery that could cause unintended actions, and session management vulnerabilities that could enable account takeover.

API security for AI/ML interfaces must address both traditional API security concerns and AI/ML-specific threats including input validation for complex data types such as images, audio, or structured data, output filtering to prevent information leakage about model internals or training data, rate limiting to prevent model extraction through systematic querying, and authentication and authorization appropriate for different types of AI/ML access patterns.

Mobile and IoT device interfaces for AI/ML systems create additional attack surfaces through device authentication and enrollment processes, edge computing security controls, data synchronization between edge and cloud systems, and device management and update mechanisms that could be exploited for persistent access or lateral movement.

This comprehensive theoretical foundation provides organizations with detailed understanding of advanced threat modeling strategies specifically designed for AI/ML environments. The focus on AI/ML-specific threats, attack surfaces, and modeling methodologies enables security teams to develop comprehensive threat models that can identify and address the unique risks associated with machine learning systems while supporting business objectives and operational requirements.
