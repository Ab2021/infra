# Day 22.1: Object Detection Fundamentals & Theory - A Practical Guide

## Introduction: What, and Where?

Image classification answers the question, "What is in this image?" Object detection takes the next crucial step, answering both "What is in this image?" and "Where is it?" It is the task of identifying and localizing one or more objects within an image by drawing a **bounding box** around each object and assigning it a class label.

This task is fundamental to computer vision and has countless real-world applications, from self-driving cars detecting pedestrians and other vehicles, to inventory management systems counting products on a shelf, to doctors identifying tumors in medical scans.

Before diving into complex detector architectures like YOLO or Faster R-CNN, it's essential to understand the fundamental concepts and terminology that underpin all of them. This guide provides a practical introduction to these core ideas.

**Today's Learning Objectives:**

1.  **Understand Bounding Box Representation:** Learn the different ways to numerically represent a bounding box (e.g., `[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]` and `[x_center, y_center, width, height]`).
2.  **Grasp the Core Challenge:** See how object detection is a multi-task problem, combining **classification** and **localization** (a regression task).
3.  **Learn the Key Evaluation Metric: Intersection over Union (IoU):** Understand, implement, and visualize IoU, the primary metric for judging the accuracy of a predicted bounding box.
4.  **Understand Average Precision (AP) and mAP:** Revisit how AP and mAP are used in the context of object detection to evaluate the performance of a model across all classes and different IoU thresholds.

## Part 1: Representing Bounding Boxes

A bounding box is simply a rectangle used to mark the location of an object. There are two common ways to represent it numerically:

1.  **`[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]` (Corner Coordinates):**
    *   This represents the coordinates of the top-left corner (`x_min`, `y_min`) and the bottom-right corner (`x_max`, `y_max`).
    *   This format is often used for calculating IoU and for visualization.

2.  **`[x_center, y_center, width, height]` (Center-Width-Height):**
    *   This represents the coordinates of the center of the box (`x_center`, `y_center`) and its overall width and height.
    *   This format is often used as the regression target for models like YOLO, as it can be more robust to changes in object scale.

It's a common task to convert between these two formats.

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as patches

print("--- Part 1: Bounding Box Representation ---")

def box_xyxy_to_xywh(box_xyxy):
    """Converts a box from [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] to [x_c, y_c, w, h]."""
    x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max = box_xyxy
    w = x_max - x_min
    h = y_max - y_min
    x_c = x_min + w / 2
    y_c = y_min + h / 2
    return [x_c, y_c, w, h]

def box_xywh_to_xyxy(box_xywh):
    """Converts a box from [x_c, y_c, w, h] to [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]."""
    x_c, y_c, w, h = box_xywh
    x_min = x_c - w / 2
    y_min = y_c - h / 2
    x_max = x_c + w / 2
    y_max = y_c + h / 2
    return [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]

# --- Example ---
box1_xyxy = [10, 20, 60, 80] # A 50x60 box with top-left at (10, 20)
box1_xywh = box_xyxy_to_xywh(box1_xyxy)

print(f"Corner format [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]: {box1_xyxy}")
print(f"Center-WH format [x_c, y_c, w, h]:         {box1_xywh}")
```

## Part 2: The Core Task - Classification + Localization

Object detection is fundamentally a **multi-task learning** problem. For each potential object, the model must perform:

1.  **Classification:** What is this object? (e.g., cat, dog, car).
2.  **Localization:** Where is this object? This is a **regression** task to predict the 4 continuous values of the bounding box coordinates.

As we saw in the toy detector implementation (Day 7.2), this is typically handled by having a shared CNN backbone that extracts features, followed by two separate "heads": a classification head and a regression head. The total loss is a weighted sum of the classification loss (e.g., Cross-Entropy) and the regression loss (e.g., L1 or Smooth L1 Loss).

## Part 3: Intersection over Union (IoU) - The Key Metric

How do we know if a predicted bounding box is "correct"? We need a way to measure the overlap between the predicted box and the ground-truth box. This is what **Intersection over Union (IoU)**, also known as the Jaccard index, does.

*   **Formula:** `IoU = (Area of Overlap) / (Area of Union)`
*   **Range:** 0 to 1.
    *   **IoU = 0:** The boxes do not overlap at all.
    *   **IoU = 1:** The boxes overlap perfectly.

In practice, we define a **threshold** (e.g., 0.5 or 0.75). If the IoU between a predicted box and a ground-truth box is above this threshold, we consider the prediction a **True Positive (TP)**. If it's below, it's a **False Positive (FP)**.

### 3.1. Implementing and Visualizing IoU

```python
print("\n--- Part 3: Intersection over Union (IoU) ---")

def calculate_iou(box_a, box_b):
    """Calculates IoU between two boxes in [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] format."""
    # Determine the coordinates of the intersection rectangle
    x_a = max(box_a[0], box_b[0])
    y_a = max(box_a[1], box_b[1])
    x_b = min(box_a[2], box_b[2])
    y_b = min(box_a[3], box_b[3])

    # Compute the area of intersection
    # The `max(0, ...)` is to handle cases where the boxes don't overlap.
    intersection_area = max(0, x_b - x_a) * max(0, y_b - y_a)

    # Compute the area of both bounding boxes
    box_a_area = (box_a[2] - box_a[0]) * (box_a[3] - box_a[1])
    box_b_area = (box_b[2] - box_b[0]) * (box_b[3] - box_b[1])

    # Compute the area of the union
    union_area = box_a_area + box_b_area - intersection_area

    # Compute the IoU
    iou = intersection_area / union_area
    return iou

# --- Example Boxes ---
ground_truth_box = [50, 50, 150, 150]
pred_box_good = [60, 60, 160, 160] # Good overlap
pred_box_bad = [160, 160, 200, 200] # No overlap

# --- Calculate IoU ---
iou_good = calculate_iou(ground_truth_box, pred_box_good)
iou_bad = calculate_iou(ground_truth_box, pred_box_bad)

print(f"IoU for the good prediction: {iou_good:.4f}")
print(f"IoU for the bad prediction: {iou_bad:.4f}")

# --- Visualize ---
def visualize_boxes(box1, box2, iou):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
    ax.set_xlim(0, 250)
    ax.set_ylim(0, 250)
    ax.set_aspect('equal')
    
    # Draw ground truth box
    rect1 = patches.Rectangle((box1[0], box1[1]), box1[2]-box1[0], box1[3]-box1[1], linewidth=2, edgecolor='g', facecolor='none', label='Ground Truth')
    ax.add_patch(rect1)
    
    # Draw predicted box
    rect2 = patches.Rectangle((box2[0], box2[1]), box2[2]-box2[0], box2[3]-box2[1], linewidth=2, edgecolor='r', facecolor='none', label='Prediction')
    ax.add_patch(rect2)
    
    plt.title(f"IoU = {iou:.2f}")
    plt.legend()
    plt.gca().invert_yaxis() # (0,0) is top-left
    plt.show()

visualize_boxes(ground_truth_box, pred_box_good, iou_good)
visualize_boxes(ground_truth_box, pred_box_bad, iou_bad)
```

## Part 4: Average Precision (AP) and mAP

Once we have defined what a True Positive is using an IoU threshold, we can evaluate the entire model.

As we saw in Day 10, **Average Precision (AP)** is the primary metric for this. It summarizes the shape of the Precision-Recall curve into a single number. It is the weighted average of precisions at each threshold, where the weight is the increase in recall.

**The Process for a Single Class:**
1.  Get all predictions for that class from the model on the test set.
2.  Sort them by their confidence scores in descending order.
3.  Iterate down the list. For each prediction, calculate if it's a TP or FP based on the IoU with ground-truth boxes.
4.  Calculate the precision and recall at each step.
5.  Plot the Precision-Recall curve and calculate the area under it. This area is the **Average Precision (AP)** for that class.

**Mean Average Precision (mAP):**
*   This is simply the average of the AP scores across all object classes.
*   `mAP = (1 / num_classes) * sum(AP_for_each_class)`

**COCO mAP:**
You will often see results reported on the COCO dataset. The standard COCO metric is particularly rigorous. It calculates the mAP averaged over **10 different IoU thresholds**, from 0.50 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05. This is often written as **mAP@[.5:.95]**. This rewards models that are very precise in their localization.

## Conclusion

Object detection is a complex but fascinating task that sits at the intersection of classification and regression. Understanding its fundamental concepts is key to understanding the architectures we will explore next.

**Key Takeaways:**

1.  **It's a Multi-Task Problem:** Object detection requires simultaneously predicting a class label (classification) and bounding box coordinates (regression).
2.  **Bounding Boxes are Vectors:** We represent object locations as 4-element vectors, typically in `[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]` or `[x_center, y_center, w, h]` format.
3.  **IoU is the Core Localization Metric:** Intersection over Union is the standard way to measure how well a predicted box aligns with a ground-truth box.
4.  **mAP is the Standard Evaluation Metric:** Mean Average Precision is the primary metric for reporting the overall performance of an object detection model, as it combines performance across all classes and multiple confidence/IoU thresholds.

With these foundational concepts in place, we are ready to explore the two main families of detector architectures: two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN and one-stage detectors like YOLO.

## Self-Assessment Questions

1.  **Bounding Box Formats:** If a box is represented as `[100, 100, 20, 40]` in `[x_c, y_c, w, h]` format, what are its coordinates in `[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]` format?
2.  **IoU:** Two identical boxes are placed right next to each other with their edges touching, but not overlapping. What is their IoU?
3.  **IoU Threshold:** You have a predicted box and a ground-truth box with an IoU of 0.6. If the evaluation threshold is 0.5, is this prediction a True Positive or a False Positive?
4.  **mAP:** What does the "m" in mAP stand for?
5.  **COCO mAP:** What does the notation `mAP@[.5:.95]` mean?
