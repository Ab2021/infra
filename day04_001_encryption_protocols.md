## Cryptographic Fundamentals

### Core Cryptographic Principles
Cryptography forms the foundation of modern network security, providing confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation for digital communications. Understanding these fundamental principles is essential for implementing secure AI/ML systems and protecting sensitive data in transit and at rest.

**Confidentiality:**
- Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized parties
- Prevents unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data
- Critical for protecting training datasets, model parameters, and inference results
- Implemented through encryption algorithms that transform plaintext into ciphertext

**Integrity:**
- Guarantees that information has not been altered in an unauthorized manner
- Detects tampering, corruption, or modification of data
- Essential for ensuring the reliability of AI/ML training data and model outputs
- Achieved through cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures

**Authentication:**
- Verifies the identity of communicating parties
- Ensures that messages originate from claimed senders
- Prevents impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks
- Particularly important in distributed AI/ML training environments

**Non-Repudiation:**
- Prevents denial of actions or transactions
- Provides proof of origin and delivery of messages
- Important for audit trails and compliance in AI/ML systems
- Implemented through digital signatures and trusted timestamping

### Cryptographic Building Blocks
**Plaintext and Ciphertext:**
- Plaintext: Original, readable information before encryption
- Ciphertext: Encrypted form of plaintext that appears random to unauthorized parties
- Transformation between plaintext and ciphertext occurs through cryptographic algorithms
- Quality of encryption depends on algorithm strength and key management

**Keys and Key Spaces:**
- Keys: Secret parameters that control cryptographic transformations
- Key space: Total number of possible keys for a given algorithm
- Key length directly impacts security strength and computational requirements
- Proper key generation, distribution, and management are critical for security

**Cryptographic Algorithms:**
- Mathematical functions that perform encryption, decryption, and authentication
- Must be publicly scrutinized and mathematically proven secure
- Algorithm choice depends on performance requirements, security needs, and implementation constraints
- Regular updates necessary as computing power advances and new attacks are discovered

### Security Models and Threat Analysis
**Computational Security:**
- Security based on computational difficulty of breaking the cryptographic scheme
- Assumes attackers have limited computational resources and time
- Most practical cryptographic systems rely on computational security
- Security level measured in terms of work factor required for successful attack

**Information-Theoretic Security:**
- Security that cannot be broken even with unlimited computational resources
- Requires keys as long as the message being protected
- Rarely practical for most applications due to key management complexity
- One-time pad is the classic example of information-theoretic security

**Attack Models:**
- Ciphertext-only attacks: Attacker has access only to ciphertext
- Known-plaintext attacks: Attacker has some plaintext-ciphertext pairs
- Chosen-plaintext attacks: Attacker can choose plaintexts and observe resulting ciphertext
- Chosen-ciphertext attacks: Attacker can choose ciphertext and observe decryption results

### Cryptographic Primitives
**Block Ciphers:**

## Symmetric Encryption Algorithms

### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the most widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm, selected by NIST in 2001 to replace the aging Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES provides strong security, efficient implementation, and flexibility for various applications.

**AES Algorithm Structure:**
- Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) design

### AES Modes of Operation
Since AES encrypts only 128-bit blocks, modes of operation are required to encrypt larger amounts of data securely. Each mode has different security properties and performance characteristics.

**Electronic Codebook (ECB) Mode:**
- Simplest mode where each block is encrypted independently
- Identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks
- Not recommended for most applications due to pattern leakage

- Sequential encryption but parallel decryption possible
- Padding required for messages not multiple of block size

**Counter (CTR) Mode:**
- Converts block cipher into stream cipher using counter values
- Parallel encryption and decryption possible
- No padding required for arbitrary-length messages
- IV/nonce must never be reused with the same key

**Galois/Counter Mode (GCM):**
