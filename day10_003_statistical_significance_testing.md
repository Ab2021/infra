# Day 10.3: Statistical Significance Testing - Rigorous Analysis for Model Comparison

## Overview

Statistical significance testing in machine learning provides the mathematical and statistical foundation for making rigorous, evidence-based claims about model performance, ensuring that observed differences are meaningful rather than artifacts of random variation or experimental design flaws. This sophisticated framework encompasses hypothesis testing methodologies specifically adapted for machine learning contexts, multiple comparison corrections to handle the inherent multiplicity in model evaluation, statistical power analysis for experimental design, and advanced techniques for handling dependent samples, temporal dependencies, and complex experimental structures. The theoretical foundations draw from classical statistics, Bayesian inference, information theory, and experimental design to provide principled approaches that distinguish genuine performance differences from statistical noise.

## Foundations of Hypothesis Testing in ML

### Classical Hypothesis Testing Framework

**Null and Alternative Hypotheses**
In model comparison contexts:
$$H_0: \mu_A - \mu_B = 0$$ (no performance difference)
$$H_1: \mu_A - \mu_B \neq 0$$ (performance difference exists)

**Type I and Type II Errors**
- **Type I Error (α)**: Falsely claiming significance when $H_0$ is true
- **Type II Error (β)**: Failing to detect significance when $H_1$ is true
- **Statistical Power**: $1 - \beta$

**P-Value Interpretation**
$$p = P(\text{observing data at least as extreme} | H_0 \text{ is true})$$

**Confidence Intervals**
For difference in means:
$$CI_{1-\alpha} = (\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B) \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \times SE(\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B)$$

### Assumptions and Violations

**Parametric Test Assumptions**
1. **Independence**: Observations are independent
2. **Normality**: Sampling distribution is normal
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Equal variances across groups
4. **Random Sampling**: Representative samples from population

**Central Limit Theorem Application**
For large samples ($n \geq 30$):
$$\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,1)$$

**Robustness Considerations**
- **Sample Size Effects**: Large samples can detect trivial differences
- **Practical vs Statistical Significance**: Effect size considerations
- **Assumption Violations**: Impact on test validity

## Tests for Model Comparison

### Paired Tests for Cross-Validation

**Paired t-Test**
For comparing two algorithms using k-fold CV:
$$t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d/\sqrt{k}}$$

Where:
- $d_i = \text{performance}_A^{(i)} - \text{performance}_B^{(i)}$
- $\bar{d} = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k d_i$
- $s_d^2 = \frac{1}{k-1}\sum_{i=1}^k (d_i - \bar{d})^2$

**Degrees of Freedom**: $df = k - 1$

**Assumptions**:
- Differences are normally distributed
- Fold performances are independent (often violated)

### Corrected Tests for CV Dependencies

**5x2CV t-Test (Dietterich)**
Use 5 repetitions of 2-fold CV to reduce dependency:
$$t = \frac{\bar{p}_1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{5}\sum_{i=1}^5 s_i^2}}$$

Where $s_i^2$ is variance of differences in repetition $i$.

**Degrees of Freedom**: $df = 5$

**Combined 5x2CV F-Test**
$$F = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^5 \sum_{j=1}^2 (p_{ij})^2}{2\sum_{i=1}^5 s_i^2}$$

**Degrees of Freedom**: $(10, 5)$

**Corrected Resampled t-Test**
Adjust for correlation in repeated CV:
$$t_{corrected} = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d \sqrt{\frac{1}{k} + \frac{n_{test}}{n_{train}}}}$$

### Non-Parametric Tests

**Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**
For non-normal differences:
$$W^+ = \sum_{i: d_i > 0} R_i$$

Where $R_i$ is rank of $|d_i|$.

**Sign Test**
$$S = \sum_{i=1}^k \mathbf{1}[d_i > 0]$$

Under $H_0$: $S \sim \text{Binomial}(k, 0.5)$

**McNemar's Test for Classification**
For comparing error patterns:
$$\chi^2 = \frac{(b - c)^2}{b + c}$$

Where:
- $b$: errors by algorithm A only
- $c$: errors by algorithm B only

### Bayesian Hypothesis Testing

**Bayesian t-Test**
$$BF_{10} = \frac{P(\text{data}|H_1)}{P(\text{data}|H_0)}$$

**Interpretation**:
- $BF_{10} > 3$: Moderate evidence for $H_1$
- $BF_{10} > 10$: Strong evidence for $H_1$
- $BF_{10} > 30$: Very strong evidence for $H_1$

**Default Priors for Effect Size**
Cauchy distribution: $\delta \sim \text{Cauchy}(0, r)$

**Posterior Probability**
$$P(H_1|\text{data}) = \frac{BF_{10} \times P(H_1)}{1 + BF_{10} \times P(H_1)}$$

## Multiple Comparison Corrections

### Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER)

**Bonferroni Correction**
For $m$ comparisons:
$$\alpha_{corrected} = \frac{\alpha}{m}$$

**Properties**:
- **Conservative**: Controls FWER exactly
- **Simple**: Easy to compute and apply
- **Power Loss**: Significant reduction in power

**Holm-Bonferroni Method**
Sequential procedure:
1. Sort p-values: $p_{(1)} \leq p_{(2)} \leq ... \leq p_{(m)}$
2. For each $i$, compare $p_{(i)}$ with $\frac{\alpha}{m+1-i}$
3. Reject $H_{(i)}$ if $p_{(i)} \leq \frac{\alpha}{m+1-i}$

**Šidák Correction**
$$\alpha_{corrected} = 1 - (1-\alpha)^{1/m}$$

**Less conservative than Bonferroni under independence**

### False Discovery Rate (FDR)

**Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure**
1. Sort p-values: $p_{(1)} \leq p_{(2)} \leq ... \leq p_{(m)}$
2. Find largest $k$ such that $p_{(k)} \leq \frac{k}{m} \alpha$
3. Reject hypotheses $H_{(1)}, ..., H_{(k)}$

**FDR Control**:
$$\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{V}{R}\right] \leq \alpha \frac{m_0}{m}$$

Where $V$ is false discoveries and $R$ is total discoveries.

**Benjamini-Yekutieli Procedure**
For dependent tests:
$$\alpha_{BY} = \frac{\alpha}{\sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{i}}$$

**Storey's q-Value**
$$q(p) = \min_{t \geq p} \frac{\pi_0 \cdot t \cdot m}{\#{p_i \leq t}}$$

Where $\pi_0$ is proportion of true null hypotheses.

### Specialized ML Corrections

**Tournament-Style Comparisons**
For comparing multiple algorithms:
$$\text{Comparisons} = \binom{k}{2} = \frac{k(k-1)}{2}$$

**Dunnett's Correction**
For comparing multiple algorithms to control:
$$\alpha_{Dunnett}(k-1, \infty) < \alpha_{Bonferroni}$$

**Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference)**
For all pairwise comparisons:
$$HSD = q_{\alpha}(k, df) \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n}}$$

### Bootstrap-Based Corrections

**Bootstrap Resampling for Multiple Tests**
1. Generate $B$ bootstrap samples
2. Compute test statistics for each comparison
3. Estimate joint distribution of test statistics
4. Use joint distribution for correction

**Permutation-Based FWER Control**
1. Perform permutation tests for all comparisons
2. Record maximum test statistic across comparisons
3. Use distribution of maximum for threshold

## Power Analysis and Sample Size

### Statistical Power Theory

**Power Function**
$$\pi(\theta) = P(\text{Reject } H_0 | \theta)$$

**Effect Size Measures**
**Cohen's d**:
$$d = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma_{pooled}}$$

**Cohen's Conventions**:
- Small effect: $d = 0.2$
- Medium effect: $d = 0.5$
- Large effect: $d = 0.8$

**Relationship Between Power Components**
$$n = \frac{2\sigma^2(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})^2}{\delta^2}$$

### A Priori Power Analysis

**Sample Size for t-Test**
For detecting effect size $d$ with power $1-\beta$:
$$n = \frac{2(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})^2}{d^2}$$

**Cross-Validation Power**
For k-fold CV comparison:
$$n_{total} = k \times n_{fold}$$

**Effect of Correlation on Power**
With correlation $\rho$ between folds:
$$\text{Effective } n = \frac{k}{1 + (k-1)\rho}$$

### Post-Hoc Power Analysis

**Observed Power**
$$\text{Power} = P(\text{Reject } H_0 | \text{observed effect})$$

**Criticisms of Post-Hoc Power**:
- Circular reasoning with p-values
- Misleading interpretation of non-significant results
- Better to use confidence intervals

**Retrospective Effect Size**
$$\hat{d} = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_{pooled}}$$

## Advanced Testing Procedures

### Equivalence Testing

**Two One-Sided Tests (TOST)**
Test if difference is within equivalence bounds $[-\Delta, \Delta]$:
$$H_0: |\mu_1 - \mu_2| \geq \Delta$$
$$H_1: |\mu_1 - \mu_2| < \Delta$$

**Test Statistics**:
$$t_1 = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - \Delta}{SE}$$
$$t_2 = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) + \Delta}{SE}$$

**Decision Rule**: Reject $H_0$ if both $t_1 < -t_{\alpha}$ and $t_2 > t_{\alpha}$

### Superiority vs Non-Inferiority Testing

**Non-Inferiority Testing**
$$H_0: \mu_A - \mu_B \leq -\Delta$$ (A is inferior)
$$H_1: \mu_A - \mu_B > -\Delta$$ (A is non-inferior)

**Test Statistic**:
$$t = \frac{(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) + \Delta}{SE}$$

**Superiority Testing**
$$H_0: \mu_A - \mu_B \leq 0$$
$$H_1: \mu_A - \mu_B > 0$$

### Sequential Testing

**Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)**
$$\Lambda_n = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i|\theta_1)}{\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i|\theta_0)}$$

**Decision Boundaries**:
- Accept $H_0$ if $\Lambda_n \leq A$
- Accept $H_1$ if $\Lambda_n \geq B$
- Continue sampling if $A < \Lambda_n < B$

**Boundary Values**:
$$A = \frac{\beta}{1-\alpha}, \quad B = \frac{1-\beta}{\alpha}$$

**Group Sequential Designs**
Interim analyses at predetermined points:
$$\alpha_i = \alpha \times f(i/K)$$

Where $f$ is spending function (e.g., O'Brien-Fleming, Pocock).

## Time Series and Dependent Data

### Autocorrelation-Adjusted Tests

**Durbin-Watson Test for Autocorrelation**
$$DW = \frac{\sum_{t=2}^T (e_t - e_{t-1})^2}{\sum_{t=1}^T e_t^2}$$

**Newey-West Standard Errors**
Robust to autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity:
$$\hat{V}_{NW} = \Gamma_0 + \sum_{j=1}^q w_j(\Gamma_j + \Gamma_j')$$

Where $w_j = 1 - \frac{j}{q+1}$ (Bartlett weights).

### Block Bootstrap for Time Series

**Moving Block Bootstrap**
1. Divide series into overlapping blocks of length $l$
2. Resample blocks with replacement
3. Concatenate to form bootstrap series

**Block Length Selection**:
$$l_{opt} = \left(\frac{2\rho^2}{1-\rho^2}\right)^{1/3} n^{1/3}$$

Where $\rho$ is first-order autocorrelation.

**Stationary Bootstrap**
Random block lengths from geometric distribution:
$$P(\text{block length} = j) = (1-p)^{j-1}p$$

### Panel Data Considerations

**Clustered Standard Errors**
Account for correlation within clusters:
$$\hat{V}_{cluster} = \left(\sum_g X_g'X_g\right)^{-1} \left(\sum_g X_g' \hat{u}_g \hat{u}_g' X_g\right) \left(\sum_g X_g'X_g\right)^{-1}$$

**Fixed Effects vs Random Effects**
**Hausman Test**:
$$H = (\hat{\beta}_{FE} - \hat{\beta}_{RE})' [\hat{V}_{FE} - \hat{V}_{RE}]^{-1} (\hat{\beta}_{FE} - \hat{\beta}_{RE})$$

## Reporting and Interpretation

### Effect Size Reporting

**Standardized Effect Sizes**
**Cohen's d**:
$$d = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{SD_{pooled}}$$

**Hedges' g** (bias-corrected):
$$g = d \times \left(1 - \frac{3}{4(n_1 + n_2) - 9}\right)$$

**Glass's Δ**:
$$\Delta = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{SD_{control}}$$

### Confidence Intervals for Effect Sizes

**CI for Cohen's d**:
$$d \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \times SE(d)$$

Where $SE(d) = \sqrt{\frac{n_1 + n_2}{n_1 n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_1 + n_2)}}$

### Practical Significance

**Minimal Important Difference (MID)**
Domain-specific thresholds for meaningful change:
- **Clinical**: Based on patient outcomes
- **Business**: Based on economic impact
- **Educational**: Based on learning objectives

**Equivalence Bounds Selection**
$$\Delta = 0.5 \times \sigma_{historical}$$

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**
$$\text{Net Benefit} = \text{Statistical Power} \times \text{Effect Value} - \text{Cost}$$

## Computational Implementation

### Resampling-Based Tests

**Permutation Test Algorithm**
1. Compute observed test statistic $T_{obs}$
2. For $i = 1$ to $B$:
   - Randomly permute group labels
   - Compute test statistic $T_i$
3. p-value = $\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^B \mathbf{1}[|T_i| \geq |T_{obs}|]$

**Bootstrap Test**
1. Compute observed difference $\hat{\theta}$
2. Generate bootstrap samples under $H_0$
3. Compute bootstrap distribution of $\hat{\theta}^*$
4. p-value = $P(|\hat{\theta}^*| \geq |\hat{\theta}|)$

### Exact Tests

**Fisher's Exact Test**
For 2×2 contingency tables:
$$p = \frac{\binom{a+b}{a}\binom{c+d}{c}}{\binom{n}{a+c}}$$

**Permutation Distribution**
For small samples, enumerate all possible permutations.

### Large Sample Approximations

**Normal Approximation**
When $n \geq 30$ and CLT applies:
$$Z = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta_0}{SE(\hat{\theta})} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$$

**Chi-Square Approximation**
For goodness-of-fit tests:
$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \sim \chi^2_{k-1-p}$$
