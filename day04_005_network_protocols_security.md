5. **Incident Response**: Rapid response to protocol security incidents

**Future Considerations:**
1. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Prepare protocols for post-quantum algorithms
2. **Zero Trust Integration**: Align protocols with zero trust architectures
3. **AI-Driven Security**: Leverage AI for protocol security enhancement
4. **Standards Evolution**: Track development of new security standards
5. **Emerging Threats**: Stay current with evolving protocol attack techniques

Success in protocol security requires understanding both fundamental security principles and the specific characteristics of protocols used in AI/ML environments, combined with continuous monitoring and adaptation to emerging threats and requirements.
