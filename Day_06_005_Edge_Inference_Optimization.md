## 🔧 Edge Computing Theoretical Framework

### **Edge vs Cloud Inference Trade-offs**

Edge inference brings computation closer to data sources, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements while introducing resource constraints and deployment complexity.

**Performance-Resource Trade-off Analysis:**
```
Edge Computing Optimization Objective:
Minimize: α × Latency + β × Energy + γ × Bandwidth + δ × Cost

Subject to:
- Memory ≤ Device_Memory_Limit
- Compute ≤ Device_FLOPS_Limit  
- Power ≤ Thermal_Design_Power
- Accuracy ≥ Minimum_Accuracy_Threshold

Where:
Latency = Inference_Time + Network_RTT (if cloud fallback)
Energy = Compute_Energy + Communication_Energy + Idle_Energy
Bandwidth = Model_Download + Data_Upload + Result_Download
Cost = Device_Cost + Network_Cost + Maintenance_Cost
```

**Edge Deployment Taxonomy:**
```
Device Categories:
1. High-End Edge (Tesla FSD, Jetson AGX):
   - 32+ TOPS AI performance
   - 32-64 GB memory
   - Active cooling available
   - Complex model deployment possible

2. Mid-Range Edge (Jetson Nano, Edge TPU):
   - 1-10 TOPS AI performance  
   - 4-16 GB memory
   - Passive cooling constraints
   - Medium model complexity

3. Resource-Constrained (Mobile, IoT):
   - <1 TOPS AI performance
   - 1-8 GB memory
   - Severe power constraints
   - Highly optimized models required

Deployment Patterns:
- Standalone: Full model on device
- Hybrid: Critical path on device, complex processing in cloud
- Hierarchical: Multi-tier processing (device → edge → cloud)
- Federated: Distributed learning across edge devices
```

### **Model Compression for Edge Deployment**

**Quantization Theory for Edge:**
```
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):
- INT8 quantization: 4× memory reduction, 2-4× speedup
- Dynamic quantization: Runtime weight quantization
- Static quantization: Calibration-based activation quantization

Quantization Error Analysis:
Quantization_Error = (Q_max - Q_min) / (2^bits - 1) × 0.5
SNR_dB = 6.02 × bits + 1.76 + 10log₁₀(Signal_Power/Noise_Power)

Advanced Quantization Techniques:
1. Mixed-bit precision: Different layers use different bit widths
2. Channel-wise quantization: Per-channel scaling factors
3. Block-wise quantization: Sub-tensor quantization granularity
4. Outlier-aware quantization: Special handling for activation outliers

Optimal Bit Allocation:
For layer i with sensitivity S_i:
bits_i = base_bits + α × log(S_i)
where α balances model size vs accuracy trade-off
```

**Knowledge Distillation Framework:**
```
Teacher-Student Optimization:
L_total = α × L_task + β × L_distillation + γ × L_regularization

Where:
L_task = CrossEntropy(y_true, y_student)
L_distillation = KL_Divergence(σ(z_teacher/T), σ(z_student/T))
L_regularization = ||θ_student||₂

Temperature Scaling:
σ(z_i/T) = exp(z_i/T) / Σⱼ exp(z_j/T)
Higher T → softer probability distributions → better knowledge transfer

Progressive Distillation:
Large Teacher → Medium Student → Small Student → Tiny Student
Each stage optimizes for specific deployment constraints

Online Distillation:
Continuous learning from teacher model deployed in cloud
Student model on edge updates periodically with distilled knowledge
```

**Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for Edge:**
```

- Kernel sizes: 3×3, 5×5, 7×7 with efficiency considerations
- Channel widths: Powers of 2 for hardware efficiency
- Skip connections: Identity, projection, none

Hardware-Aware Cost Models:
Latency_predicted = Σᵢ (Op_latency_i × Op_count_i)
Memory_predicted = max(Intermediate_activations) + Parameter_memory
Energy_predicted = Σᵢ (Op_energy_i × Op_frequency_i)

Evolutionary Search Strategy:
1. Population initialization with diverse architectures
2. Mutation operators: Add/remove layers, change operators
3. Crossover: Combine successful architectural patterns
4. Selection: Multi-objective optimization (Pareto frontier)

## 🌐 Federated Learning and Edge Intelligence

### **Federated Learning Theoretical Framework**

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Federated Optimization Problem:
min_θ f(θ) = Σᵢ (n_i/n) × F_i(θ)

n_i = number of samples at client i
n = total number of samples across all clients

FedAvg Algorithm:
1. Server broadcasts global model θ_t
2. Each client k performs E local epochs:
   θ_k^(t+1) = θ_t - η∇F_k(θ_t)
3. Server aggregates updates:
   θ_(t+1) = Σ_k (n_k/n) × θ_k^(t+1)

Convergence Analysis:

Under IID data: Linear convergence possible
Communication rounds vs local epochs trade-off
```
