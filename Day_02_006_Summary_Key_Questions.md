## 🧠 Key Questions & Assessments

### **Beginner Level Questions (20 points each)**

#### **Q1: Streaming Fundamentals**
**Question**: "Explain the difference between event-time and processing-time in streaming systems. Give a practical example where this difference matters."

**Expected Answer**:
- **Event-time**: When the event actually occurred in the real world
- **Processing-time**: When the system processes the event
- **Example**: IoT sensor data where network delays cause events to arrive out of order
- **Impact**: Event-time ensures correct temporal analysis despite processing delays

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Clear distinction between the two time concepts (5 points)
- Practical example provided (5 points)
- Understanding of why this matters (5 points)
- Correct terminology usage (5 points)

#### **Q2: Watermark Purpose**
**Question**: "What is a watermark in stream processing, and why is it necessary? What happens without watermarks?"

**Expected Answer**:
- **Definition**: Watermark is a timestamp assertion that no events with timestamp ≤ W will arrive
- **Purpose**: Enables systems to make progress on event-time computations
- **Without watermarks**: System would wait indefinitely for potentially late events
- **Trade-off**: Balance between correctness (waiting for late events) and latency (making progress)

#### **Q3: Partition Strategy Impact**
**Question**: "You have a Kafka topic with 1000 producers sending data. How would you decide the number of partitions, and what are the trade-offs?"

**Expected Answer**:
- **Throughput consideration**: Each partition can handle ~125MB/s
- **Consumer parallelism**: Max consumers limited by partition count
- **Storage consideration**: Avoid very large partitions (>1GB)
- **Broker distribution**: Spread partitions across brokers
- **Recommendation**: Start with 2x number of brokers, monitor and adjust

### **Intermediate Level Questions (30 points each)**

#### **Q4: Checkpoint Barrier Alignment**
**Question**: "In Flink's checkpointing mechanism, explain what happens when checkpoint barriers arrive out of order across multiple input streams. How does barrier alignment work?"

**Expected Answer**:
- **Barrier alignment**: Wait for barriers from all input streams before proceeding
- **Channel blocking**: Block faster channels to wait for slower ones
- **Record buffering**: Buffer records from blocked channels
- **Trade-off**: Consistency vs latency (alignment increases latency)
- **Alternative**: Unaligned checkpoints for lower latency

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Understanding of barrier concept (8 points)
- Explanation of alignment process (8 points)
- Recognition of trade-offs (7 points)
- Knowledge of alternatives (7 points)

#### **Q5: Stream-Stream Join Complexity**
**Question**: "Design a solution for joining two high-velocity streams (100k events/sec each) where events need to be matched within a 30-second time window. What are the main challenges and how would you address them?"

**Expected Answer**:
- **State management**: Need to buffer events for 30 seconds
- **Memory requirements**: 30s × 200k events/s = 6M events in memory
- **Join algorithms**: Hash join with time-based partitioning
- **Cleanup strategy**: Regular cleanup of expired events
- **Scalability**: Partition by join key for horizontal scaling

#### **Q6: Exactly-Once vs Performance**
**Question**: "Your streaming application needs to process 1M events/second with exactly-once guarantees. The current checkpoint interval is 5 seconds and causing 2-second processing delays. How would you optimize this?"

**Expected Answer**:
- **Reduce checkpoint frequency**: Increase interval to 30-60 seconds
- **Incremental checkpointing**: Only checkpoint changed state
- **Asynchronous checkpointing**: Overlap checkpointing with processing
- **State backend optimization**: Use RocksDB for large state
- **Trade-off analysis**: Balance between recovery time and performance

### **Advanced Level Questions (40 points each)**

#### **Q7: Multi-Source Watermark Coordination**
**Question**: "You have 5 different data sources feeding into your streaming pipeline, each with different lateness characteristics. Source A is always on time, Source B has 10% late events (up to 5 minutes late), Source C occasionally goes offline for 30 minutes. Design a watermark generation strategy that balances correctness with processing latency."

**Expected Solution Approach**:
```python
class AdaptiveWatermarkStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.source_profiles = {
            'source_a': {'reliability': 0.99, 'max_lateness_ms': 1000},
            'source_b': {'reliability': 0.90, 'max_lateness_ms': 300000},
            'source_c': {'reliability': 0.85, 'max_lateness_ms': 1800000}
        }
    
    def calculate_global_watermark(self, source_watermarks):
        # Weight watermarks by source reliability
        # Handle offline sources with timeout mechanism
        # Implement progressive watermark advancement
        pass
```

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Recognition of multi-source complexity (10 points)
- Adaptive watermark strategy design (10 points)
- Handling of offline sources (10 points)
- Performance vs correctness trade-offs (10 points)

#### **Q8: State Management Optimization**
**Question**: "Your stateful streaming application processes user session data with 10M active users. Each user session maintains 50KB of state. Memory usage is becoming a bottleneck. Design a state management strategy that maintains performance while reducing memory footprint."

**Expected Solution Approach**:
- **State compaction**: Compress frequently accessed state
- **Tiered storage**: Hot (memory), warm (SSD), cold (disk) state tiers
- **State TTL**: Automatic cleanup of inactive sessions
- **Lazy loading**: Load state on demand from persistent store
- **State partitioning**: Distribute state across multiple nodes

#### **Q9: Feature Drift Detection**
**Question**: "Design a real-time feature drift detection system that can identify when the statistical properties of streaming features change significantly. The system should handle 1M feature computations per second and detect drift within 5 minutes."

**Expected Solution Components**:
```python
class RealTimeFeatureDriftDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.reference_distributions = {}
        self.sliding_window_stats = {}
        self.drift_detection_algorithms = [
            'kolmogorov_smirnov_test',
            'population_stability_index',
            'jensen_shannon_divergence'
        ]
    
    def detect_drift(self, feature_name, feature_value, timestamp):
        # Update sliding window statistics
        # Compare against reference distribution
        # Apply multiple drift detection algorithms
        # Return drift probability and severity
        pass
```

## 🔥 Tricky Scenarios & Problem Solving

### **Scenario 1: The Cascading Lateness Problem**

**Situation**: "Your streaming pipeline has 5 stages: Ingestion → Processing → Enrichment → Aggregation → Output. Stage 3 (Enrichment) occasionally takes 30 seconds due to external API calls. This causes all downstream watermarks to lag, leading to delayed window closures. How do you maintain low-latency processing while handling the enrichment delays?"

**Analysis Framework**:
1. **Root Cause**: External dependency blocking watermark progression
2. **Impact**: Downstream stages wait unnecessarily for watermarks
3. **Solutions**:
   - Asynchronous enrichment with best-effort delivery
   - Separate pipeline for time-critical vs enriched data
   - Timeout-based watermark advancement
   - Side-channel for late enrichment results

**Implementation Strategy**:
```python
class AsynchronousEnrichmentProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.fast_path_processor = FastPathProcessor()
        self.enrichment_processor = AsyncEnrichmentProcessor()
        self.result_merger = ResultMerger()
    
    def process_event(self, event, watermark):
        # Fast path: Pass through immediately with basic processing
        fast_result = self.fast_path_processor.process(event)
        
        # Async enrichment: Process in background
        enrichment_future = self.enrichment_processor.enrich_async(event)
        
        # Emit fast result immediately
        self.emit_result(fast_result, watermark)
        
        # Handle enrichment completion asynchronously
        enrichment_future.then(lambda enriched_data: 
            self.result_merger.merge_enrichment(fast_result.id, enriched_data)
        )
```

### **Scenario 2: The Memory Explosion Mystery**

**Situation**: "Your Flink job's memory usage grows linearly over time and eventually hits OutOfMemoryError after 6 hours. The job processes user clickstream data and maintains session state. Memory profiling shows that old session states are not being cleaned up. What debugging steps would you take, and how would you fix this?"

**Debugging Methodology**:
1. **State Size Analysis**: Check which keyed states are growing
2. **TTL Configuration**: Verify state TTL settings
3. **Cleanup Triggers**: Ensure timer-based cleanup is working
4. **Watermark Progression**: Check if watermarks are advancing properly
5. **Key Distribution**: Analyze if certain keys are accumulating excessive state

**Solution Implementation**:
```python
class SessionStateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.session_states = {}
        self.cleanup_timer = Timer()
        self.state_ttl_ms = 3600000  # 1 hour
        
    def process_event(self, event, timestamp):
        session_id = event.session_id
        
        # Update session state
        if session_id not in self.session_states:
            self.session_states[session_id] = SessionState()
            
            # Register cleanup timer
            cleanup_time = timestamp + self.state_ttl_ms
            self.cleanup_timer.register(cleanup_time, 
                lambda: self.cleanup_session(session_id))
        
        self.session_states[session_id].update(event, timestamp)
    
    def cleanup_session(self, session_id):
        if session_id in self.session_states:
            del self.session_states[session_id]
```

### **Scenario 3: The Exactly-Once Paradox**

**Situation**: "Your exactly-once streaming pipeline occasionally produces duplicate records in the output. Investigation shows that Kafka transactions are working correctly, checkpoints are successful, but duplicates appear during failure recovery. What could be causing this, and how would you diagnose it?"

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. **Transaction Boundary Analysis**: Check if output operations are within transaction scope
2. **Checkpoint Recovery Logic**: Verify that recovery doesn't replay already-committed data
3. **Sink Idempotency**: Ensure sink can handle duplicate writes
4. **Offset Management**: Check consumer offset vs checkpoint offset alignment

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```python
class ExactlyOnceDebugging:
    def analyze_duplicate_records(self, duplicate_records):
        analysis = {}
        
        for record in duplicate_records:
            # Check transaction metadata
            tx_id = record.headers.get('transaction_id')
            checkpoint_id = record.headers.get('checkpoint_id')
            
            # Analyze timing
            first_write_time = record.headers.get('first_write_time')
            duplicate_write_time = record.headers.get('write_time')
            
            analysis[record.id] = {
                'transaction_id': tx_id,
                'checkpoint_id': checkpoint_id,
                'time_between_writes': duplicate_write_time - first_write_time,
                'potential_cause': self.identify_cause(record)
            }
        
        return analysis
    
    def identify_cause(self, record):
        # Logic to identify root cause based on metadata
        # Could be: checkpoint recovery, transaction timeout, sink failure
        pass
```
