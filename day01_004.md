```python
def cohort_analysis(user_data, recommendation_start_date):
    cohorts = user_data.groupby(user_data['first_recommendation_date']
                              .dt.to_period('M'))
    
    cohort_sizes = cohorts['user_id'].nunique()
    cohort_table = cohorts.groupby([
        cohorts['first_recommendation_date'].dt.to_period('M'),
        user_data['activity_date'].dt.to_period('M')
    ])['user_id'].nunique().reset_index()

## Offline vs Online Evaluation

### Offline Evaluation

#### **Advantages**
- **Cost-effective**: No need for user experiments
- **Reproducible**: Consistent evaluation across models
- **Fast iteration**: Quick model comparison and selection
- **Historical analysis**: Evaluate on past data

#### **Limitations**
- **Dataset bias**: Historical data may not represent current user behavior
- **Temporal effects**: Static evaluation misses dynamic user preferences
- **Interaction effects**: Cannot measure user adaptation to recommendations
- **Business metric disconnect**: Accuracy metrics may not correlate with business success

#### **Common Offline Evaluation Approaches**
**Temporal Splitting**: Train on past data, test on future data
```python
def temporal_split(data, split_date):
    train_data = data[data['timestamp'] < split_date]
    test_data = data[data['timestamp'] >= split_date]
    return train_data, test_data
```

**User Splitting**: Different users for train/test
**Random Splitting**: Random sample for testing (least realistic)

### Online Evaluation

#### **A/B Testing Framework**
**Randomized Controlled Trials** for recommendation systems:
- **Control Group**: Baseline recommendation system
- **Treatment Group**: New recommendation system
- **Random Assignment**: Users randomly assigned to groups
- **Statistical Significance**: Measure confidence in results

#### **Multi-Armed Bandit Testing**
**Adaptive Experimentation**: Dynamically allocate traffic based on performance
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balance learning with optimization
- **Thompson Sampling**: Bayesian approach to bandit problems
- **Contextual Bandits**: Consider user/item features in decision making

### Online Evaluation Challenges

#### **Network Effects**
**User Interactions**: Users influence each other's behavior
**Platform Effects**: Changes affect overall ecosystem
**Temporal Dependencies**: User behavior changes over time

#### **Statistical Challenges**
**Sample Size Requirements**: Large user bases needed for significance
**Statistical Power**: Ability to detect meaningful differences
**Multiple Testing**: Correction for multiple simultaneous experiments

---

## Metric Trade-offs and Relationships

### Fundamental Trade-offs

#### **Accuracy vs Diversity**
**The Pareto Frontier**: Cannot optimize both simultaneously
- High accuracy often means recommending popular, similar items
- High diversity may reduce immediate relevance
- Optimal balance depends on business goals and user context

#### **Short-term vs Long-term Optimization**
**Immediate Gratification vs User Growth**:
- Clickbait recommendations boost short-term engagement
- Quality recommendations build long-term trust and retention
- Temporal discount factors in optimization

#### **Personalization vs Privacy**
**Data-Performance Trade-off**:
- More personal data enables better recommendations
- Privacy regulations limit data collection and usage
- Differential privacy techniques add noise, reducing accuracy

### Metric Correlation Analysis

#### **Business-Algorithm Metric Relationships**
Common correlations (industry-dependent):
- **NDCG ↔ User Satisfaction**: Generally positive, but context-dependent
- **CTR ↔ Revenue**: Often positive, but clickbait can break correlation
- **Diversity ↔ Long-term Engagement**: Complex relationship

#### **Leading vs Lagging Indicators**
**Leading Indicators**: Predict future performance
- Daily active users
- Session depth
- User feedback quality

**Lagging Indicators**: Measure outcomes
- Monthly revenue
- Customer lifetime value
- Market share

## A/B Testing for Recommendations

### Experimental Design Principles

#### **Randomization Strategies**
**User-level Randomization**: Most common approach
- Ensures consistent user experience
- Prevents within-user contamination
- Requires large user base for statistical power

**Session-level Randomization**: Different algorithm per session
- Higher statistical power
- Risk of confusing user experience
- Useful for short-term experiments

**Item-level Randomization**: Different algorithms for different items
- Complex interaction effects
- Difficult to measure overall system performance

#### **Statistical Considerations**
**Sample Size Calculation**:
```
n = (Z_α/2 + Z_β)² × (σ₁² + σ₂²) / (μ₁ - μ₂)²
where:
n = required sample size per group
Z_α/2 = critical value for significance level
Z_β = critical value for power
σ = standard deviation
μ = mean values
```

**Power Analysis**: Probability of detecting true effect
**Effect Size**: Magnitude of difference to detect
**Significance Level**: Probability of Type I error (false positive)

### Practical A/B Testing Challenges

#### **Novelty Effects**
**User Adaptation**: Performance changes as users adapt to new system
**Honeymoon Period**: Initial excitement may inflate metrics
**Long-term Impact**: Short experiments may miss long-term effects

#### **Interaction Effects**
**Network Externalities**: User behavior affects other users
**Platform-wide Effects**: Algorithm changes affect entire ecosystem
**Spillover Effects**: Treatment effects leak to control group

### Advanced Experimental Designs

#### **Multi-Armed Bandits**
**Adaptive Allocation**: Shift traffic to better-performing variants
**Regret Minimization**: Balance exploration with exploitation
**Contextual Bandits**: Personalize experiment participation

#### **Factorial Designs**
**Multiple Factors**: Test combinations of changes simultaneously
**Interaction Effects**: Measure how factors interact
**Efficiency**: Test multiple hypotheses in single experiment

---

## Long-term Impact Measurement

### Cohort Analysis for Recommendations

#### **User Lifecycle Tracking**
Track user behavior changes after recommendation system improvements:
```python
def recommendation_cohort_analysis(users, recommendation_start_date, metrics):
    """
    Analyze long-term impact of recommendation system on user cohorts
    """
    cohorts = users.groupby(pd.Grouper(key='first_recommendation_date', 
                                       freq='M'))
    
    cohort_data = []
    for name, cohort in cohorts:
        cohort_metrics = calculate_cohort_metrics(cohort, metrics)
        cohort_data.append({
            'cohort_month': name,
            'cohort_size': len(cohort),
            **cohort_metrics
        })
    
    return pd.DataFrame(cohort_data)
```

#### **Retention Analysis**
**N-Day Retention**: Percentage of users active N days after first recommendation
**Survival Analysis**: Time-to-churn modeling
**Cohort Comparison**: Before/after recommendation system improvements

### Customer Lifetime Value Evolution

#### **CLV Attribution to Recommendations**
**Direct Attribution**: Purchases directly from recommendations
**Indirect Attribution**: Increased engagement leading to organic purchases
**Assisted Attribution**: Recommendations in conversion path

#### **Predictive CLV Modeling**
Use recommendation engagement to predict future customer value:
```python
def predict_clv_with_recommendations(user_features, recommendation_features):
    """
    Predict customer lifetime value incorporating recommendation engagement
    """
    combined_features = np.concatenate([
        user_features,
        recommendation_features
    ], axis=1)
    
    # Use machine learning model to predict CLV
    clv_prediction = clv_model.predict(combined_features)
    return clv_prediction
```
