```

### **Inference Performance Metrics Framework**

**Latency Analysis:**
```
End-to-End Latency Decomposition:
L_total = L_preprocessing + L_inference + L_postprocessing + L_overhead

Where:
L_inference = L_compute + L_memory + L_synchronization
L_overhead = L_framework + L_kernel_launch + L_data_transfer

Latency Optimization Targets:
- Real-time applications: <16ms (60 FPS)
- Interactive applications: <100ms
- Batch processing: Throughput optimization primary concern
```

**Throughput vs Latency Trade-offs:**
```
Little's Law Application:
Throughput = Concurrent_Requests / Average_Latency

Batch Size Impact:
- Larger batches: Higher throughput, higher latency
- Smaller batches: Lower latency, lower throughput
- Optimal batch size depends on hardware utilization characteristics

Where:
scale = (max_value - min_value) / (2^bits - 1)
zero_point = round(-min_value / scale)

Quantization Error Analysis:
E[errorÂ²] = scaleÂ² / 12 (uniform distribution assumption)

```

**Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):**

- bits_i âˆˆ {1, 2, 4, 8} typically

Sensitivity Analysis:
sensitivity_i = ||âˆ‚loss/âˆ‚weight_i||
Higher sensitivity layers require more bits
```
