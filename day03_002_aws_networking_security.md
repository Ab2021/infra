## AWS VPC Fundamentals

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Overview
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. VPC gives you complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

### Key VPC Components
**IP Address Ranges (CIDR Blocks):**
- Primary CIDR block defines the main IP address range for the VPC
- Secondary CIDR blocks can be added to expand address space
- Support for IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
- CIDR blocks must be between /16 and /28 for IPv4
- Cannot overlap with other VPCs in peering relationships

**Availability Zones and Subnets:**
- VPCs span multiple Availability Zones within a region
- Subnets are created within specific Availability Zones
- Public subnets have routes to internet gateways
- Private subnets do not have direct internet access
- Each subnet must be associated with a route table

**Route Tables:**
- Control traffic routing within the VPC and to external networks
- Each subnet must be associated with a route table
- Local routes are automatically created for VPC CIDR blocks
- Custom routes can be added for specific destinations
- Route priority is determined by longest prefix matching

### Default vs Custom VPC
**Default VPC Characteristics:**

## Security Groups Deep Dive

### Security Group Fundamentals
Security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, providing stateful packet filtering at the instance level. They are fundamental to AWS network security and are applied directly to elastic network interfaces (ENIs).

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stateful Nature**: Return traffic is automatically allowed for established connections
- **Instance-Level Application**: Applied to ENIs, not subnets
- **Allow Rules Only**: Can only specify allow rules; all other traffic is implicitly denied
- **Rule Evaluation**: All applicable rules are evaluated; most permissive rule wins
- **Dynamic Updates**: Changes take effect immediately without instance restart

### Security Group Rule Components
**Rule Elements:**
- **Type**: Predefined protocols (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS) or custom protocols
- **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, or all protocols
- **Port Range**: Specific ports, port ranges, or all ports
- **Source/Destination**: IP addresses, CIDR blocks, or other security groups
- **Description**: Optional description for documentation purposes

**Source and Destination Options:**
- **IP Addresses**: Specific IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
- **CIDR Blocks**: Network ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
- **Security Groups**: Reference to other security groups
- **Prefix Lists**: Managed lists of IP ranges (e.g., S3, CloudFront)
- **VPC Endpoints**: Reference to VPC endpoint services

### Security Group Best Practices
**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- Grant only the minimum access required for functionality
- Use specific port ranges instead of opening all ports
- Regularly review and remove unnecessary rules
- Implement time-bound access where appropriate

**Rule Organization:**
- Use descriptive names for security groups
- Group similar resources under common security groups
- Separate inbound and outbound rules logically
- Document rule purposes in descriptions

**Source Specification:**
- Avoid using 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere) when possible
- Use specific IP ranges or security groups as sources
- Implement bastion hosts for administrative access
- Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager instead of SSH where possible

### Advanced Security Group Patterns
**Layered Security Groups:**
- Base security group with common rules
- Application-specific security groups for specialized access
- Administrative security groups for management access
- Security groups for different environments (dev, test, prod)

**Referenced Security Groups:**
- Security groups can reference other security groups as sources
- Enables dynamic access control as instances join/leave groups
- Simplifies rule management for complex architectures
- Supports micro-segmentation patterns

**Cross-VPC Security Groups:**
- Security groups can reference groups in peered VPCs
- Enables consistent security policies across VPCs
- Requires VPC peering or Transit Gateway connectivity
- Useful for hybrid and multi-VPC architectures

### Security Group Monitoring and Auditing

## Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

### NACL Fundamentals
Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level, offering stateless packet filtering for all traffic entering or leaving a subnet.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stateless Nature**: Each packet is evaluated independently
- **Subnet-Level Application**: Applied to all instances in a subnet
- **Allow and Deny Rules**: Can specify both allow and deny rules
- **Rule Order**: Rules are processed in numerical order
- **Default Behavior**: Default NACL allows all traffic; custom NACLs deny all traffic by default

### NACL Rule Structure
**Rule Components:**
- **Rule Number**: Determines processing order (1-32766)
- **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, or all protocols
- **Rule Action**: Allow or deny
- **Port Range**: Specific ports or ranges
- **Source/Destination**: IP addresses or CIDR blocks

**Rule Processing:**
1. Rules are evaluated in ascending numerical order
2. First matching rule determines the action
3. If no rules match, traffic is denied
4. Lower-numbered rules have higher priority

### NACL vs Security Groups Comparison
**When to Use NACLs:**
- Subnet-level security controls
- Compliance requirements for network-level filtering
- Defense in depth alongside security groups
- Emergency traffic blocking capabilities
- Stateless filtering requirements

**When to Use Security Groups:**
- Instance-level security controls
- Application-specific access requirements
- Dynamic environments with frequent changes
- Stateful connection tracking

**Complementary Usage:**
- NACLs provide coarse-grained subnet-level filtering
- Security groups provide fine-grained instance-level filtering
- Both can be used together for layered security
- NACLs can serve as a backup control for security groups

### NACL Design Patterns
**Default Allow Pattern:**
- Use default NACL that allows all traffic
- Rely primarily on security groups for access control
- Simplifies management for most environments
- Suitable for environments with well-designed security groups

**Explicit Deny Pattern:**
- Create custom NACLs with explicit allow rules
- Deny traffic at the subnet level as primary control
- More complex but provides additional security
- Suitable for high-security environments

**Hybrid Pattern:**
- Combine default and custom NACLs based on subnet sensitivity
- Public subnets use restrictive NACLs
- Private subnets may use more permissive NACLs
- Administrative subnets use highly restrictive NACLs

### NACL Best Practices
**Rule Numbering:**
- Leave gaps between rule numbers for future insertions
- Use consistent numbering schemes across environments
- Reserve low numbers for high-priority rules
- Document rule numbering conventions

**Ephemeral Port Considerations:**
- Allow ephemeral ports for outbound return traffic
- Understand client operating system ephemeral port ranges
- Linux: 32768-65535, Windows: 1024-5000 (older), 49152-65535 (newer)
- Consider using security groups for easier stateful handling

**Change Management:**
- Test NACL changes in non-production environments
- Implement changes during maintenance windows
- Have rollback procedures for problematic changes
- Monitor traffic patterns after changes
