## 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation Fundamentals

### 1.1 The RAG Paradigm

**Motivation for RAG**

**Limitations of Pure Generation**
Large language models, despite their impressive capabilities, have inherent limitations:
- **Knowledge Cutoff**: Training data has temporal limitations

**Core RAG Principle**
RAG combines the parametric knowledge of language models with the non-parametric knowledge of retrieval systems:
- **Parametric Knowledge**: Knowledge encoded in model parameters during training
- **Non-Parametric Knowledge**: External knowledge accessed through retrieval
- **Dynamic Integration**: Combine both types of knowledge during generation
- **Contextual Relevance**: Retrieve information relevant to current context
