## 1. Microservices Architecture for Recommendation Systems

### 1.1 Decomposition Strategies

**Domain-Driven Decomposition**

The foundation of microservices architecture lies in proper domain decomposition. For recommendation systems, we can identify several bounded contexts:

- **User Management Service**: Handles user profiles, preferences, and authentication
- **Content/Item Service**: Manages item catalog, metadata, and content features
- **Interaction Service**: Tracks user-item interactions, ratings, and behavioral data
- **Feature Engineering Service**: Computes and caches user and item features
- **Model Training Service**: Handles batch training and model updates
- **Inference Service**: Provides real-time recommendations
- **Personalization Service**: Applies business rules and personalization logic
- **Analytics Service**: Provides metrics, A/B testing, and performance monitoring

**Data Decomposition Principles**

Each service should own its data and expose well-defined APIs. This follows the principle of data encapsulation:

- Services communicate through APIs, never direct database access
- Each service has its own database or data store
- Data consistency is achieved through eventual consistency patterns
- Shared data is accessed through dedicated services

**Service Boundaries and Contracts**

Defining clear service boundaries is crucial:
- **Functional Cohesion**: Services group related functionality
- **Data Cohesion**: Services own related data entities
- **Temporal Cohesion**: Services handle operations with similar timing requirements
- **Sequential Cohesion**: Services manage sequential workflows

### 1.2 Communication Patterns

**Synchronous Communication**

REST APIs and GraphQL are common for synchronous communication:
- Request-response pattern for immediate data needs
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- API gateway for routing and cross-cutting concerns
- Load balancing for high availability

**Asynchronous Communication**

Event-driven patterns for decoupled communication:
- **Event Sourcing**: Store state changes as events
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate read/write models
- **Saga Pattern**: Manage distributed transactions
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time data propagation

**Message Queues and Event Streams**

Different messaging patterns serve different needs:
- **Point-to-Point**: Direct service communication
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Event broadcasting
- **Request-Reply**: Asynchronous RPC
- **Event Streaming**: Continuous data flows

### 1.3 Data Management in Microservices

**Database Per Service Pattern**

Each microservice manages its own data:
- Avoids tight coupling between services
- Enables independent scaling and optimization
- Allows technology diversity (polyglot persistence)
- Ensures data ownership and responsibility

**Data Consistency Patterns**

Managing consistency across services:
- **Eventually Consistent**: Accept temporary inconsistency
- **Saga Pattern**: Choreographed or orchestrated transactions
- **Event Sourcing**: Reconstruct state from events
- **CQRS**: Separate command and query responsibilities

**Data Synchronization Strategies**

Keeping data consistent across services:
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Track database changes
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Propagate changes through events
- **Periodic Synchronization**: Batch data reconciliation
- **Dual Writes**: Write to multiple systems (with caution)

## 2. Event-Driven Architecture

### 2.1 Event Design Principles

**Event Granularity**

Choosing the right level of detail:
- **Fine-grained events**: More flexibility, higher volume
- **Coarse-grained events**: Less volume, potential coupling
- **Composite events**: Aggregate related changes

### 2.2 Event Streaming Architecture

### 2.3 Event Sourcing and CQRS

**Event Sourcing Fundamentals**

Store state as a sequence of events:
- **Benefits**: Complete audit trail, temporal queries, replay capability

**CQRS Implementation**

Separate read and write models:
- **Command side**: Handle state changes
