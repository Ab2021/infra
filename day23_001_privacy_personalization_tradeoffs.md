### 3.1 Differential Privacy

**Fundamental Concepts**

**Mathematical Definition**
- **ε-Differential Privacy**: Mechanism M satisfies ε-differential privacy if for any two datasets D₁, D₂ differing by one record, and any output S: P(M(D₁) ∈ S) ≤ e^ε × P(M(D₂) ∈ S)
- **Privacy Budget**: Total amount of privacy loss allowed (ε parameter)
- **Composition**: Privacy loss accumulates across multiple queries

- **Exponential Mechanism**: For non-numeric outputs, sample proportional to utility
- **Gaussian Mechanism**: Add Gaussian noise with proper calibration
- **Report Noisy Max**: For selecting best option while preserving privacy

**Applications in Recommendation Systems**

**Query Response Privacy**
```python
# Example: Private query response for recommendation counts
def private_item_popularity(item_counts, epsilon):
    """
    Return item popularity counts with differential privacy
    
    Args:
        item_counts: Dictionary of item_id -> count
        epsilon: Privacy parameter
    """
    sensitivity = 1  # One user can affect count by at most 1
    scale = sensitivity / epsilon
    
    private_counts = {}
    for item_id, count in item_counts.items():
        # Add Laplace noise
        noise = np.random.laplace(0, scale)
        private_counts[item_id] = max(0, count + noise)
    
    return private_counts
```

**Private Learning**

- **Composition Tracking**: Managing privacy budget across multiple operations
- **Implementation Complexity**: Correct implementation requires expertise

### 3.2 Federated Learning

**Core Principles**

**Decentralized Training**
- **Local Computation**: Machine learning training happens on user devices
- **Model Updates Only**: Only model parameters shared, not raw data
- **Aggregation**: Central server aggregates model updates from devices
- **Privacy Preservation**: Raw user data never leaves the device

**Federated Averaging Algorithm**
- **Client Selection**: Select random subset of clients for each round
- **Local Training**: Clients train on local data for several epochs
- **Upload Updates**: Clients upload model parameter updates
- **Server Aggregation**: Server averages updates to create global model

**Implementation Considerations**

**System Heterogeneity**
- **Device Capabilities**: Varying computational power across devices
- **Network Conditions**: Intermittent and variable network connectivity
- **Data Distribution**: Non-IID data distribution across clients
- **Participation Patterns**: Clients may join and leave unpredictably

**Privacy Enhancements**
- **Secure Aggregation**: Cryptographic protocols to protect individual updates
- **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to model updates for additional privacy
- **Client Sampling**: Random sampling to prevent individual client identification
- **Model Compression**: Reduce communication overhead and information leakage

**Applications in Recommendation Systems**

**Mobile App Recommendations**
```python
# Conceptual federated learning for mobile recommendations
class FederatedRecommender:
    def __init__(self, global_model):
        self.global_model = global_model
        self.client_models = {}
    
    def train_round(self, selected_clients):
        """One round of federated learning"""
        client_updates = []
        
        for client_id in selected_clients:
            # Client trains on local data
            local_model = self.global_model.copy()
            local_update = self.train_local(client_id, local_model)
            client_updates.append(local_update)
        
        # Aggregate updates
        self.global_model = self.aggregate_updates(client_updates)
    
    def train_local(self, client_id, model):
        """Train model on client's local data"""
        # This would run on the client device
        local_data = self.get_client_data(client_id)
        # Train for several epochs on local data
        for epoch in range(local_epochs):
            model.train_step(local_data)
        return model.get_update()
```

- **Somewhat Homomorphic**: Limited number of operations before noise becomes too large
- **Fully Homomorphic**: Unlimited operations (but currently impractical for large systems)
- **Leveled Homomorphic**: Support bounded number of operations

**Applications in Privacy-Preserving Recommendations**

**Private Information Retrieval**
```python
# Conceptual example: Private database query
def private_recommendation_query(encrypted_user_profile, encrypted_database):
    """
    Query recommendation database without revealing user profile
    or learning database contents
    """
    # Homomorphically compute similarity scores
    encrypted_scores = []
    for encrypted_item in encrypted_database:
        # Compute dot product homomorphically
        encrypted_score = homomorphic_dot_product(
            encrypted_user_profile, 
            encrypted_item
        )
        encrypted_scores.append(encrypted_score)
    
    # Return encrypted results (client decrypts)
    return encrypted_scores
```

**Secure Multi-Party Computation**

        self.utility_weights = utility_weights
    
    def optimize_system(self, candidate_systems):
        """Find optimal system configuration"""
        pareto_front = []
        
        for system in candidate_systems:
            privacy_loss = self.measure_privacy_loss(system)
            utility_score = self.measure_utility(system)
            
            if privacy_loss <= self.privacy_constraint:
                pareto_front.append({
                    'system': system,
                    'privacy_loss': privacy_loss,
                    'utility_score': utility_score
                })
        
        # Find pareto-optimal solutions

    def measure_privacy_loss(self, system):
        """Measure total privacy loss of system"""
        # Combine different privacy measures
        dp_loss = system.get_differential_privacy_loss()
        reident_risk = system.get_reidentification_risk()
        info_leakage = system.get_information_leakage()

    def __init__(self):
        self.local_model = None
        self.global_trends = None
    
    def initialize(self, global_trends):
        """Initialize with global, non-personal trends"""
        self.global_trends = global_trends
        self.local_model = self.create_empty_model()
    
    def process_user_interaction(self, interaction):
        """Update local model based on user interaction"""
        # All processing happens locally
        self.local_model.update(interaction)
        
        # Don't send personal data to server
