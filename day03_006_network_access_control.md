## Zero Trust Architecture Fundamentals

### Zero Trust Principles and Philosophy
Zero Trust is a security model that operates on the principle "never trust, always verify." Unlike traditional perimeter-based security models, Zero Trust assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network and therefore requires verification for every access request.

**Core Principles:**
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every access request must be authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and systems receive minimum necessary permissions
- **Assume Breach**: Design systems assuming attackers are already inside the network
- **Verify Explicitly**: Use all available data points for access decisions
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitor and validate all activities

**Shift from Traditional Security:**
- **Perimeter-Based to Identity-Based**: Security based on identity rather than network location
- **Static to Dynamic**: Dynamic security policies based on real-time context
- **Implicit Trust to Explicit Verification**: Explicit verification for every access attempt
- **Network-Centric to Data-Centric**: Focus on protecting data rather than network boundaries

### Zero Trust Maturity Model
