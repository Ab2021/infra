## 📚 Theoretical Foundation

### 1. Introduction to Network Virtualization

#### 1.1 Network Virtualization Fundamentals

**Definition and Core Concepts**:
Network virtualization creates logical networks that are decoupled from the underlying physical network infrastructure. This abstraction enables multiple virtual networks to coexist on the same physical infrastructure while maintaining isolation and independent addressing.

**Key Drivers for Network Virtualization in AI/ML**:
1. **Multi-Tenancy**: Multiple AI projects sharing the same physical infrastructure
2. **Elasticity**: Dynamic scaling of compute resources without network reconfiguration
3. **Portability**: Moving AI workloads between different physical locations
4. **Isolation**: Securing sensitive AI models and datasets
5. **Cloud Integration**: Hybrid deployments spanning on-premises and cloud

**Traditional Network Limitations**:
```
VLAN Scalability Issues:
- 4,094 VLAN limit insufficient for large cloud environments
- Spanning tree limitations in multi-tenant scenarios
- Manual configuration complexity
- Limited mobility across Layer 3 boundaries

Physical Network Constraints:
- Fixed topology and addressing schemes
- Manual provisioning and configuration
- Limited flexibility for dynamic workloads
- Tight coupling between logical and physical networks
```

#### 1.2 Network Virtualization Architecture

**Overlay vs Underlay Networks**:
```
Underlay Network:
- Physical network infrastructure
- Provides IP connectivity between endpoints
- Remains unchanged during overlay operations
- Handles routing and switching of encapsulated packets

Overlay Network:
- Logical network built on top of underlay
- Provides virtual networking services
- Handles tenant traffic and isolation
- Implements network policies and services
```

**Encapsulation Principles**:
Network virtualization uses packet encapsulation to create virtual networks:
```
Original Packet:
[Inner Ethernet][Inner IP][Payload]

Encapsulated Packet:
[Outer Ethernet][Outer IP][Tunnel Header][Inner Ethernet][Inner IP][Payload]

Benefits:
- Original packet preserved end-to-end
- Tunnel header provides virtualization metadata
- Underlay network sees only outer headers
- Multiple virtual networks share same physical infrastructure
```

#### 1.3 AI/ML Specific Requirements
