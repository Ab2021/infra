## 1. Introduction to RL for Recommendations

### 1.1 Why Reinforcement Learning for Recommendations?

**Limitations of Traditional Approaches**

**Static Nature of Supervised Learning**
Traditional recommendation approaches treat recommendation as a static prediction problem:
- **Single-Shot Predictions**: Each recommendation is independent
- **No Sequential Learning**: Cannot adapt based on user reactions
- **Limited Feedback**: Only uses final outcomes (clicks, purchases)
- **No Long-Term Optimization**: Focuses on immediate rather than long-term user satisfaction

**Missing Interactive Dynamics**
- **User Feedback Loop**: Traditional methods don't model how recommendations affect user behavior
- **Recommendation Impact**: How current recommendations influence future user preferences
- **Temporal Dependencies**: Relationships between recommendations over time
- **Dynamic User Preferences**: User preferences evolve based on recommendations received

**The RL Advantage**

**Sequential Decision Making**
RL naturally models recommendation as a sequential process:
- **Multi-Step Process**: Recommendations are part of ongoing interaction
- **Learning from Interaction**: System learns from user responses to recommendations
- **Adaptive Behavior**: System adapts strategy based on user feedback
- **Long-Term Optimization**: Optimizes for cumulative long-term reward

**Online Learning Capabilities**
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Adapt to user behavior in real-time
- **Exploration**: Systematically explore new recommendation strategies
- **Personalization**: Learn personalized policies for individual users
- **Cold Start Handling**: Use exploration to handle new users and items

### 1.2 RL Framework for Recommendations

**Core RL Components**

**Agent**
The recommendation system that makes decisions:
- **Policy**: Strategy for selecting recommendations
- **Learning Algorithm**: Method for improving policy over time
- **Value Function**: Estimate of expected future rewards
- **Model**: Understanding of how environment responds to actions

**Environment**
The user and content ecosystem:
- **Users**: Individual users with preferences and behaviors
- **Items**: Content, products, or services to recommend
- **Context**: Time, location, device, social setting
- **External Factors**: Trends, seasonality, competitive actions

**State Space**
Information available to the agent when making decisions:
- **User Profile**: Demographics, preferences, history
- **Session Context**: Current session information and history
- **Item Features**: Characteristics of available items
- **System State**: Overall system conditions and constraints

**Action Space**
Possible recommendations the agent can make:
- **Item Selection**: Which specific items to recommend
- **Ranking**: How to order recommended items
- **Presentation**: How to present recommendations to user
- **Timing**: When to make recommendations

**Reward Function**
Feedback signal indicating quality of recommendations:
- **Immediate Rewards**: Clicks, views, ratings, purchases
- **Delayed Rewards**: Long-term engagement, retention, lifetime value
- **Implicit Feedback**: Dwell time, scroll behavior, return visits
- **Explicit Feedback**: Ratings, thumbs up/down, reviews

### 1.3 RL Problem Formulations

**Markov Decision Process (MDP) Formulation**

**Formal Definition**
A recommendation MDP is defined by tuple (S, A, P, R, γ):
- **S**: Set of possible states (user contexts, system states)
- **A**: Set of possible actions (recommendations)
- **P**: Transition probabilities P(s'|s,a)
- **R**: Reward function R(s,a,s')
- **γ**: Discount factor for future rewards

**Markov Property**
The next state depends only on current state and action:
- **State Sufficiency**: Current state contains all relevant history
- **Memoryless Property**: Future depends only on present, not past
- **Practical Implications**: Need to design states that capture relevant history
- **State Augmentation**: Add history to state when Markov property is violated

**Policy Optimization**
Find policy π that maximizes expected cumulative reward:
- **Policy Definition**: π(a|s) = probability of taking action a in state s
- **Value Function**: V^π(s) = expected cumulative reward from state s
- **Action-Value Function**: Q^π(s,a) = expected reward from taking action a in state s
- **Optimal Policy**: π* = argmax_π V^π(s) for all states s

**Multi-Armed Bandit Formulation**

**Contextual Bandits**
Simplified RL formulation for recommendations:
- **Context**: User and situational information
- **Arms**: Available items or recommendation strategies
- **Rewards**: User feedback on recommendations
- **No State Transitions**: Each decision is independent

**Advantages for Recommendations**
- **Simpler Formulation**: Easier to implement and analyze
- **Real-Time Learning**: Fast adaptation to user feedback
- **Exploration Control**: Direct control over exploration-exploitation trade-off
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Well-understood regret bounds

**Linear Bandits**
- **Linear Reward Model**: Reward is linear function of context and action features
- **Feature Representations**: Both context and actions represented as feature vectors
- **LinUCB Algorithm**: Upper confidence bound approach for linear bandits
- **Computational Efficiency**: Efficient algorithms for large action spaces
