# Day 15.1: Transformer Architecture Fundamentals - Self-Attention and Architectural Innovation

## Overview

The Transformer architecture represents a revolutionary paradigm shift in sequence modeling and natural language processing, introducing the concept of self-attention as a fundamental mechanism for capturing long-range dependencies without the sequential processing constraints inherent in recurrent neural networks. Developed by Vaswani et al. in the seminal "Attention Is All You Need" paper, the Transformer architecture abandons recurrence and convolution entirely, relying instead on attention mechanisms to compute representations of sequences in parallel, enabling unprecedented training efficiency and modeling capability for complex sequential relationships. This architectural innovation has not only transformed natural language processing but has also found success in computer vision, multimodal learning, and other domains requiring sophisticated pattern recognition and sequence understanding. The Transformer's success stems from its ability to capture global dependencies, parallel computation efficiency, and the scalability that enables training on massive datasets, leading to breakthrough performance in machine translation, language modeling, and numerous downstream applications.

## Historical Context and Motivation

### Limitations of Sequential Models

**Recurrent Neural Network Constraints**
RNNs process sequences sequentially: $\mathbf{h}_t = f(\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, \mathbf{x}_t)$

**Key Limitations**:
- **Sequential Processing**: Cannot parallelize training across time steps
- **Long-range Dependencies**: Gradient vanishing/exploding for distant relationships
- **Memory Bottleneck**: Fixed-size hidden state limits information capacity
- **Computational Efficiency**: Linear scaling with sequence length

**LSTM/GRU Improvements**
While LSTMs and GRUs addressed some issues:
- **Partial Solution**: Still sequential, though better gradient flow
- **Complexity**: Additional gating mechanisms increase computational overhead
- **Limited Parallelization**: Training remains fundamentally sequential

**CNN Limitations for Sequences**
Convolutional approaches face different challenges:
- **Local Receptive Fields**: Require deep stacks for long-range dependencies
- **Fixed Kernel Size**: Limited flexibility in capturing variable-length patterns
- **Translation Invariance**: Not always desirable for structured sequences

### Attention Mechanism Evolution

**Early Attention in Seq2Seq**
$$\alpha_{t,s} = \frac{\exp(e_{t,s})}{\sum_{s'=1}^{S} \exp(e_{t,s'})}$$
$$\mathbf{c}_t = \sum_{s=1}^{S} \alpha_{t,s} \mathbf{h}_s$$

**Additive Attention (Bahdanau)**
$$e_{t,s} = \mathbf{v}_a^T \tanh(W_a [\mathbf{h}_t; \mathbf{h}_s])$$

**Multiplicative Attention (Luong)**
$$e_{t,s} = \mathbf{h}_t^T W_a \mathbf{h}_s$$

**Key Insight**: Attention allows direct access to all positions, enabling parallel computation and global context modeling.

## Transformer Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles

**1. Attention-Only Architecture**
Replace recurrence with self-attention mechanisms that compute representations by attending to all positions in the sequence simultaneously.

**2. Parallel Processing**
Enable parallel computation across sequence positions, dramatically improving training efficiency on modern hardware.

**3. Position-Agnostic Operations**
Design operations that work regardless of absolute position, using explicit positional encodings to inject sequence order information.

**4. Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**
Facilitate training of deep networks through skip connections and normalization strategies.

### High-Level Architecture

**Encoder-Decoder Structure**
$$\text{Encoder}: \mathbf{X} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}$$
$$\text{Decoder}: \mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{Y}_{<t} \rightarrow \mathbf{Y}_t$$

**Encoder Stack**
- $N = 6$ identical layers
- Each layer: Multi-Head Self-Attention + Position-wise Feed-Forward
- Residual connections and layer normalization

**Decoder Stack**
- $N = 6$ identical layers  
- Each layer: Masked Self-Attention + Encoder-Decoder Attention + Feed-Forward
- Residual connections and layer normalization

**Mathematical Representation**
$$\text{Encoder}(\mathbf{X}) = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{X} + \text{MultiHead}(\mathbf{X}))$$
$$\text{followed by LayerNorm}(\mathbf{Z} + \text{FFN}(\mathbf{Z}))$$

## Self-Attention Mechanism

### Mathematical Foundation

**Scaled Dot-Product Attention**
$$\text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\mathbf{V}$$

where:
- $\mathbf{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$: Query matrix
- $\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$: Key matrix  
- $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_v}$: Value matrix
- $d_k$: Dimension of queries and keys
- $n$: Sequence length

**Intuitive Interpretation**
1. **Queries** represent "what we're looking for"
2. **Keys** represent "what's available to match against"
3. **Values** represent "the information to retrieve"
4. **Attention weights** determine relevance of each position

**Step-by-Step Computation**
1. **Similarity Scores**: $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T$
2. **Scaled Scores**: $\mathbf{S}_{scaled} = \frac{\mathbf{S}}{\sqrt{d_k}}$
3. **Attention Weights**: $\mathbf{A} = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{S}_{scaled})$
4. **Weighted Values**: $\mathbf{Output} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{V}$

### Scaling Factor Analysis

**Why Scale by $\sqrt{d_k}$?**
Without scaling, dot products grow large for high dimensions:
$$\text{Var}[\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{k}] = d_k \cdot \text{Var}[q_i] \cdot \text{Var}[k_i]$$

**Problem**: Large dot products push softmax into saturation regions
$$\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_j e^{x_j}} \approx \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x_i \text{ is largest} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Solution**: Scale to maintain reasonable variance
$$\text{Var}\left[\frac{\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{k}}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right] = \text{Var}[q_i] \cdot \text{Var}[k_i]$$

**Empirical Verification**
For $d_k = 64$: Unscaled attention often produces near-one-hot distributions
For scaled attention: Smoother, more informative attention distributions

### Self-Attention vs Cross-Attention

**Self-Attention**
Queries, keys, and values all derived from the same sequence:
$$\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{X}W_Q, \quad \mathbf{K} = \mathbf{X}W_K, \quad \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{X}W_V$$

**Cross-Attention (Encoder-Decoder)**
Queries from decoder, keys and values from encoder:
$$\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{Y}W_Q, \quad \mathbf{K} = \mathbf{Z}W_K, \quad \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{Z}W_V$$

**Computational Complexity**
- **Time**: $O(n^2 \cdot d)$ where $n$ is sequence length
- **Space**: $O(n^2)$ for attention matrix storage
- **Comparison**: RNN is $O(n \cdot d^2)$ but sequential

## Multi-Head Attention

### Motivation for Multiple Heads

**Representational Capacity**
Single attention head captures one type of relationship. Multiple heads allow:
- Different heads focus on different linguistic phenomena
- Syntactic relationships (subject-verb, modifier-noun)  
- Semantic relationships (coreference, entity mentions)
- Positional relationships (local vs long-range dependencies)

**Parallel Subspaces**
Instead of single large attention computation:
$$\text{MultiHead}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O$$

where each head operates in a lower-dimensional subspace:
$$\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}W_i^Q, \mathbf{K}W_i^K, \mathbf{V}W_i^V)$$

### Mathematical Formulation

**Parameter Matrices**
For $h$ heads with model dimension $d_{model}$:
- $W_i^Q, W_i^K \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_k}$ where $d_k = d_{model}/h$
- $W_i^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_v}$ where $d_v = d_{model}/h$  
- $W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{h \cdot d_v \times d_{model}}$

**Computational Process**
1. **Project to subspaces**: For each head $i$
   $$\mathbf{Q}_i = \mathbf{Q}W_i^Q, \quad \mathbf{K}_i = \mathbf{K}W_i^K, \quad \mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}W_i^V$$

2. **Compute attention**: For each head independently
   $$\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}_i, \mathbf{K}_i, \mathbf{V}_i)$$

3. **Concatenate**: Combine all head outputs
   $$\text{Concat} = [\text{head}_1; \text{head}_2; ...; \text{head}_h]$$

4. **Output projection**: Transform back to model dimension
   $$\text{MultiHead} = \text{Concat} \cdot W^O$$

**Standard Configuration**
- $h = 8$ heads
- $d_{model} = 512$
- $d_k = d_v = 64$ (per head)
- Total parameters per layer: $4 \times d_{model}^2$ (same as single head)

### Attention Head Specialization

**Empirical Analysis of Head Functions**
Research has shown different heads learn different patterns:

**Syntactic Heads**
- Focus on grammatical relationships
- High attention between subjects and predicates
- Modifier-head noun relationships

**Semantic Heads**  
- Capture semantic similarity
- Coreference relationships
- Entity mention clustering

**Positional Heads**
- Local attention patterns (adjacent words)
- Long-range dependencies
- Structural patterns (beginning/end of sentences)

**Mathematical Analysis**
Attention entropy measures head specialization:
$$H(\text{head}_i) = -\sum_{j=1}^{n} \alpha_{i,j} \log \alpha_{i,j}$$

- **Low entropy**: Focused, specialized attention
- **High entropy**: Distributed, general attention

## Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks

### Architecture and Purpose

**Two-Layer MLP Design**
$$\text{FFN}(\mathbf{x}) = \max(0, \mathbf{x}W_1 + \mathbf{b}_1)W_2 + \mathbf{b}_2$$

**Parameter Dimensions**
- $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_{ff}}$ where $d_{ff} = 2048$
- $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{ff} \times d_{model}}$
- Applied to each position independently

**Functional Role**
1. **Non-linearity**: ReLU activation introduces non-linear transformations
2. **Capacity**: Larger intermediate dimension ($d_{ff} > d_{model}$) provides representational power
3. **Position-wise**: Independent transformation at each sequence position
4. **Information Integration**: Combines information from multi-head attention

### Mathematical Properties

**Position Independence**
$$\text{FFN}(\mathbf{x}_i) = f(\mathbf{x}_i) \quad \forall i$$

Each position is transformed independently, maintaining sequence structure while allowing complex transformations.

**Expansion and Contraction**
- **Expansion**: $d_{model} \rightarrow d_{ff}$ (512 → 2048)
- **Transformation**: Non-linear activation and mixing
- **Contraction**: $d_{ff} \rightarrow d_{model}$ (2048 → 512)

**Computational Complexity**
- **Parameters**: $2 \times d_{model} \times d_{ff} = 2 \times 512 \times 2048 \approx 2M$
- **Operations**: $O(n \cdot d_{model} \cdot d_{ff})$ where $n$ is sequence length

### Alternative Activation Functions

**ReLU (Original)**
$$\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)$$
- Simple, computationally efficient
- Can cause "dead neurons" problem

**GELU (Modern Preference)**
$$\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]$$
- Smoother activation function
- Better gradient flow
- Used in BERT and other modern models

**Swish**
$$\text{Swish}(x) = x \cdot \sigma(\beta x)$$
- Self-gated activation
- Smooth, non-monotonic
- Good empirical performance

## Residual Connections and Layer Normalization

### Residual Connections

**Mathematical Formulation**
$$\text{Output} = \mathbf{x} + \text{Sublayer}(\mathbf{x})$$

where $\text{Sublayer}(\mathbf{x})$ is either multi-head attention or feed-forward network.

**Benefits**
1. **Gradient Flow**: Direct path for gradients to earlier layers
2. **Identity Mapping**: Network can learn to ignore a sublayer if needed
3. **Training Stability**: Reduces optimization difficulties in deep networks

**Mathematical Analysis**
Gradient with respect to earlier layers:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \text{Output}} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \text{Output}} \frac{\partial \text{Sublayer}(\mathbf{x})}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$$

The first term provides a direct gradient path, ensuring information flow even if $\frac{\partial \text{Sublayer}(\mathbf{x})}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$ is small.

### Layer Normalization

**Mathematical Definition**
$$\text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mu}{\sigma} \odot \boldsymbol{\gamma} + \boldsymbol{\beta}$$

where:
- $\mu = \frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i$ (mean across features)
- $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=1}^{d} (x_i - \mu)^2}$ (standard deviation)
- $\boldsymbol{\gamma}, \boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (learnable parameters)

**Layer Norm vs Batch Norm**
| Aspect | Layer Norm | Batch Norm |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Normalization | Across features | Across batch |
| Dependencies | No batch size dependency | Requires batch statistics |
| RNN/Sequence | Works well | Problematic |
| Inference | Same as training | Requires running statistics |

**Pre-norm vs Post-norm**
**Post-norm (Original Transformer)**:
$$\text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{x} + \text{Sublayer}(\mathbf{x}))$$

**Pre-norm (Modern Preference)**:
$$\mathbf{x} + \text{Sublayer}(\text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{x}))$$

Pre-norm provides better gradient flow and training stability.

## Positional Encoding

### Necessity of Position Information

**Position-Agnostic Attention**
Self-attention is permutation-invariant:
$$\text{Attention}(P\mathbf{Q}, P\mathbf{K}, P\mathbf{V}) = P \cdot \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V})$$

for any permutation matrix $P$.

**Problem**: Without position information, "The cat sat on the mat" and "cat The on sat mat the" would have identical representations.

### Sinusoidal Position Encoding

**Mathematical Definition**
$$PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)$$
$$PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)$$

where:
- $pos$: Position in sequence
- $i$: Dimension index
- $d_{model}$: Model dimension

**Properties**
1. **Unique Encoding**: Each position has a unique encoding
2. **Relative Distances**: Can represent relative positions
3. **Extrapolation**: Can handle sequences longer than training

**Wavelength Analysis**
Different dimensions have different wavelengths:
- Lower dimensions: High frequency, capture fine-grained position differences
- Higher dimensions: Low frequency, capture coarse-grained relationships

**Linear Combination Property**
$$PE_{pos+k} = A_k \cdot PE_{pos} + B_k \cdot PE_{pos}$$

This allows the model to learn relative position relationships.

### Alternative Position Encodings

**Learned Positional Embeddings**
$$PE = \text{Embedding}(pos)$$

- Learned during training like word embeddings
- More flexible but limited to training sequence lengths
- Used in BERT and other models

**Relative Position Encoding**
Incorporate relative distances directly in attention:
$$e_{ij} = \frac{(\mathbf{x}_i W_Q)(\mathbf{x}_j W_K + \mathbf{r}_{i-j})^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}$$

where $\mathbf{r}_{i-j}$ is relative position encoding.

**Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)**
$$\mathbf{q}_m = f(\mathbf{q}, m), \quad \mathbf{k}_n = f(\mathbf{k}, n)$$

where $f$ rotates embeddings based on position, maintaining relative relationships.

## Encoder Architecture Deep Dive

### Single Encoder Layer

**Layer Structure**
```
Input → Multi-Head Self-Attention → Add & Norm → 
        Feed-Forward → Add & Norm → Output
```

**Mathematical Flow**
1. **Multi-Head Attention**:
   $$\mathbf{Z}_1 = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{X} + \text{MultiHead}(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{X}))$$

2. **Feed-Forward**:
   $$\mathbf{Z}_2 = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{Z}_1 + \text{FFN}(\mathbf{Z}_1))$$

**Information Flow**
- Self-attention enables each position to attend to all positions
- Feed-forward provides position-wise non-linear transformation
- Residual connections maintain information flow
- Layer normalization stabilizes training

### Encoder Stack Properties

**Depth Effects**
- **Lower layers**: Local patterns, syntactic relationships
- **Middle layers**: Compositional meaning, phrase-level understanding  
- **Upper layers**: Global context, semantic relationships

**Representational Hierarchy**
$$\mathbf{h}^{(0)} = \mathbf{X} + PE$$
$$\mathbf{h}^{(l)} = \text{EncoderLayer}^{(l)}(\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)})$$

Each layer builds increasingly abstract representations.

**Parallel Processing Benefits**
All positions processed simultaneously at each layer:
- Training parallelization across sequence positions
- Efficient GPU/TPU utilization
- Reduced training time compared to sequential models

## Decoder Architecture Deep Dive

### Masked Self-Attention

**Autoregressive Generation**
Decoder must generate tokens left-to-right without "seeing the future":
$$P(y_t | y_{<t}, \mathbf{x}) = \text{softmax}(W \mathbf{h}_t)$$

**Masking Mechanism**
Apply attention mask to prevent information flow from future positions:
$$\text{mask}_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } j \leq i \\
-\infty & \text{if } j > i
\end{cases}$$

**Masked Attention Computation**
$$\text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T + \text{Mask}}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\mathbf{V}$$

**Causal Attention Matrix**
$$\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_{1,1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\alpha_{2,1} & \alpha_{2,2} & 0 & 0 \\
\alpha_{3,1} & \alpha_{3,2} & \alpha_{3,3} & 0 \\
\alpha_{4,1} & \alpha_{4,2} & \alpha_{4,3} & \alpha_{4,4}
\end{bmatrix}$$

### Encoder-Decoder Attention

**Cross-Attention Mechanism**
Decoder attends to encoder representations:
- **Queries**: From decoder (current decoding state)
- **Keys & Values**: From encoder (source sequence)

$$\text{CrossAttention} = \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}_{dec}, \mathbf{K}_{enc}, \mathbf{V}_{enc})$$

**Information Integration**
Each decoder position can attend to all encoder positions:
- Translation alignment: source words → target words
- Context integration: relevant source information for each target position
- Dynamic attention: attention weights change based on decoding state

### Decoder Layer Structure

**Three Sub-layers**
1. **Masked Self-Attention**: Process target sequence causally
2. **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Attend to source sequence
3. **Feed-Forward**: Position-wise transformation

**Mathematical Flow**
$$\mathbf{Y}_1 = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{Y} + \text{MaskedSelfAttention}(\mathbf{Y}))$$
$$\mathbf{Y}_2 = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{Y}_1 + \text{CrossAttention}(\mathbf{Y}_1, \mathbf{Z}))$$
$$\mathbf{Y}_3 = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{Y}_2 + \text{FFN}(\mathbf{Y}_2))$$
