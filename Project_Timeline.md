# 2-Week Implementation Timeline: Agentic Building Coverage Analysis

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Implement 1+3 agent architecture for building coverage analysis
- **Stage 1**: Single extraction agent (21 indicators + monetary candidates)
- **Stage 2**: 3 financial reasoning agents (Context, Calculation, Validation)

## Week 1: Foundation & Core Implementation

### Day 1-2: Setup
- Environment setup with existing dependencies
- Install LangGraph, asyncio, required libraries
- Memory & state management implementation
- Project structure creation

### Day 3-4: Stage 1 Agent
- Complete keyword library (21 indicators)
- Unified extraction agent with 4-stage prompt chain
- Integration with existing TextProcessor
- JSON parsing with fallbacks

### Day 5: Validation Systems
- Comprehensive validator with original rules
- Logical consistency checker
- Temporal analyzer
- Confidence threshold validation (0.6-0.95)

## Week 2: Stage 2 Agents & Integration

### Day 6-7: Financial Reasoning Agents
- Context Analysis Agent (damage severity, operational impact)
- Calculation Agent (feature-informed ranking, multipliers)
- Validation Agent (reasonableness checks, quality reflection)

### Day 8-9: Orchestration
- LangGraph workflow implementation
- Conditional routing logic
- Integration with existing DataFrameTransformations
- End-to-end testing

### Day 10: Testing & Validation
- System integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Quality assurance
- Edge case handling

## Key Milestones
- **Day 2**: Environment ready
- **Day 4**: Stage 1 agent functional
- **Day 5**: Validation systems complete
- **Day 7**: All Stage 2 agents implemented
- **Day 9**: Full workflow operational
- **Day 10**: Production ready

## Team Requirements
- Senior AI Engineer (Lead)
- ML Engineer (Stage 1)
- Backend Engineer (Integration)
- QA Engineer (Testing)

## Success Metrics
- 95%+ extraction accuracy
- <30 seconds processing time
- 100% consistency rule enforcement
- All 21 indicators preserved

## Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Stage 1 complexity → 2-agent fallback ready
- **Medium Risk**: LangGraph complexity → Linear workflow backup
- **Medium Risk**: API limits → Rate limiting + local fallback
