## 🖼️ Digital Image Representation Theory

### Mathematical Foundation of Digital Images

**Continuous vs Discrete Representation**:
A digital image is a discrete sampling of a continuous 2D signal f(x,y) representing light intensity or color information.

**Sampling Process**:
```
Continuous Image: f(x,y) where x,y ∈ ℝ
Digital Image: f[m,n] where m,n ∈ ℤ, 0 ≤ m < M, 0 ≤ n < N
```

**Spatial Resolution**: The number of pixels per unit area
- **High Resolution**: More samples, better detail preservation
- **Low Resolution**: Fewer samples, potential aliasing artifacts

**Quantization**: Converting continuous intensity values to discrete levels
```
Quantized Value = floor((Continuous Value / Max Value) × (2^B - 1))
where B is the number of bits per sample
```

### Image Dimensionality and Tensor Structure

## 💾 Memory Layout and Data Structures

### Array Memory Organization

#### Row-Major vs Column-Major Order

- Cache-friendly for column access
- Default in MATLAB, some scientific libraries

#### Stride and Memory Access Patterns
**Stride Definition**: Number of bytes between consecutive elements along each dimension
**Contiguous Arrays**: Minimal stride, optimal cache performance
**Non-Contiguous Arrays**: Larger strides, potential cache misses

**Performance Implications**:
```
Access Time = Base Time + (Cache Misses × Miss Penalty)
Cache Performance ∝ Memory Access Pattern Regularity
```

### Channel Layout Considerations

#### Interleaved vs Planar Storage
**Interleaved (HWC/NHWC)**:

**TensorFlow**: Historically NHWC, now supports both
**OpenCV**: Typically HWC interleaved
**PIL**: HWC interleaved

### Memory Alignment and Padding

## 🎯 Advanced Understanding Questions

### Fundamental Concepts:
1. **Q**: Explain why the choice between HWC and CHW memory layout affects computational performance in different scenarios.
   **A**: HWC layout provides better spatial locality for pixel-wise operations, improving cache performance for image processing tasks. CHW layout enables efficient vectorized operations across channels and is optimal for convolution operations that process entire feature maps channel by channel.

2. **Q**: Analyze the mathematical relationship between sampling rate, aliasing, and image quality in digital imaging.
   **A**: According to the Nyquist theorem, sampling rate must be at least twice the highest spatial frequency to avoid aliasing. Insufficient sampling creates false patterns (moiré effects) and loss of high-frequency detail, while oversampling increases file size without perceptual benefit.

3. **Q**: Compare the theoretical compression limits and practical achievements of lossless vs lossy image compression.
   **A**: Lossless compression is bounded by Shannon entropy of the image data (typically 1-4 bits/pixel for natural images). Lossy compression can achieve much higher ratios by exploiting perceptual redundancy, with JPEG achieving 10-50:1 compression by removing imperceptible information.

### Advanced Analysis:
4. **Q**: Derive the mathematical relationship between quantization bit depth and dynamic range in digital images.
   **A**: Dynamic range = 20 × log₁₀(2^B) = B × 20 × log₁₀(2) ≈ 6.02B dB, where B is bit depth. Each additional bit doubles the number of representable levels and adds ~6dB of dynamic range.

5. **Q**: Explain how the discrete cosine transform in JPEG compression exploits properties of the human visual system.
   **A**: DCT separates image into spatial frequency components. Human vision is less sensitive to high spatial frequencies, allowing aggressive quantization of high-frequency DCT coefficients with minimal perceptual impact. The 8×8 block size matches the spatial resolution limits of human vision.

6. **Q**: Analyze the trade-offs between different color space representations for computer vision applications.
   **A**: RGB is device-dependent but computationally efficient. LAB provides perceptual uniformity for color matching but requires conversion overhead. HSV separates color information from intensity, useful for robust feature extraction under varying illumination conditions.

### Research-Level Questions:
7. **Q**: Evaluate the theoretical and practical implications of raw sensor data processing versus processed image formats for machine learning applications.
   **A**: Raw data provides maximum information content and linear response but requires complex processing pipeline. Processed formats (JPEG) apply non-linear transformations and compression that may remove information useful for ML but provide consistent, standardized input. Choice depends on application requirements and computational constraints.

8. **Q**: Assess the impact of different memory layout patterns on modern GPU architecture performance for computer vision workloads.
   **A**: GPU memory coalescing requires consecutive threads to access consecutive memory locations. NCHW layout enables coalesced access patterns for convolution operations, improving bandwidth utilization. Memory layout interacts with tensor core usage, shared memory efficiency, and cache behavior to determine overall performance.
