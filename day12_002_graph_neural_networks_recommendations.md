## 1. Graph Neural Networks Fundamentals

### 1.1 From Traditional Networks to Graph Networks

**Limitations of Traditional Neural Networks**

**Euclidean vs Non-Euclidean Data**
Traditional neural networks are designed for Euclidean data structures:
- **Grid-like Structures**: Images (2D grids), sequences (1D grids)
- **Fixed Topology**: Regular, predefined spatial relationships
- **Translation Invariance**: Convolution kernels work regardless of position
- **Limited Expressiveness**: Cannot naturally handle irregular graph structures

**Graph-Structured Data Characteristics**
- **Irregular Structure**: Nodes have variable numbers of neighbors
- **Permutation Invariance**: Node ordering should not affect results
- **Relational Information**: Edges carry important semantic information
- **Global Structure**: Need to consider both local and global graph properties

**Why GNNs for Recommendations?**

**Natural Graph Structure**
Recommendation systems naturally involve graph structures:
- **User-Item Bipartite Graphs**: Users and items connected by interactions
- **Social Networks**: User-user relationships and social influences
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Entity-relation-entity triples
- **Heterogeneous Graphs**: Multiple types of nodes and edges

**Advantages of Graph Modeling**
- **Higher-Order Relationships**: Capture multi-hop relationships
- **Rich Context**: Incorporate diverse types of relationships
- **Inductive Learning**: Generalize to new nodes and relationships
- **Interpretable Paths**: Provide explanation through graph paths

### 1.2 Core GNN Principles

**Message Passing Framework**

**General GNN Computation**
The core idea of GNNs is message passing between neighboring nodes:

1. **Message Computation**: m_{ij}^{(l)} = Message(h_i^{(l)}, h_j^{(l)}, e_{ij})
2. **Message Aggregation**: m_i^{(l)} = Aggregate({m_{ij}^{(l)} : j ∈ N(i)})
3. **Node Update**: h_i^{(l+1)} = Update(h_i^{(l)}, m_i^{(l)})

Where:
- h_i^{(l)} is the representation of node i at layer l
- N(i) is the neighborhood of node i
- e_{ij} is the edge features between nodes i and j

**Key Design Choices**
- **Message Function**: How to compute messages between nodes
- **Aggregation Function**: How to combine messages from neighbors
- **Update Function**: How to update node representations
- **Readout Function**: How to obtain graph-level representations

**Permutation Invariance**
GNNs must be invariant to node ordering:
- **Symmetric Aggregation**: Sum, mean, max operations preserve invariance
- **Set Functions**: Aggregation functions that work on sets rather than sequences
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Weighted aggregation based on learned attention
- **Pooling Operations**: Graph-level pooling that preserves invariance

### 1.3 Basic GNN Architectures

**Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)**

**Spectral Convolution Foundation**
GCNs are based on spectral graph theory:
- **Graph Laplacian**: L = D - A (degree matrix minus adjacency matrix)
- **Spectral Decomposition**: Eigendecomposition of graph Laplacian
- **Localized Filters**: Approximate spectral filters with local operations
- **Efficient Implementation**: Linear complexity in number of edges

**GCN Layer Computation**
H^{(l+1)} = σ(D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2} H^{(l)} W^{(l)})

Where:
- A is adjacency matrix with added self-loops
- D is degree matrix
- H^{(l)} is node features at layer l
- W^{(l)} is learnable weight matrix
- σ is activation function

**GraphSAGE: Inductive Learning**

**Sampling and Aggregation**
GraphSAGE enables inductive learning through sampling:

2. **Aggregate Features**: Aggregate features from sampled neighbors
3. **Generate Embeddings**: Compute node embeddings through multiple layers
4. **Supervised Learning**: Train using node classification or link prediction

**Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**

**Attention Mechanism**
GAT uses attention to weight neighbor contributions:
- **Attention Coefficients**: α_{ij} = softmax(LeakyReLU(a^T[W h_i || W h_j]))
- **Weighted Aggregation**: h_i' = σ(Σ_{j∈N(i)} α_{ij} W h_j)

**Heterogeneous Graph Definition**
A heterogeneous graph G = (V, E, φ, ψ) where:

h_i^{(l+1)} = σ(W_0^{(l)} h_i^{(l)} + Σ_{r∈R} Σ_{j∈N_i^r} (1/|N_i^r|) W_r^{(l)} h_j^{(l)})

Where:
- N_i^r is the set of neighbors of node i under relation r
- W_r^{(l)} is relation-specific weight matrix

1. **Node-Level Attention**: Weight importance of neighbors within meta-paths
2. **Semantic-Level Attention**: Weight importance of different meta-paths

**Node-Level Attention**
For meta-path Φ:
α_{ij}^Φ = softmax(σ(a_Φ^T [h_i || h_j]))

**Semantic-Level Attention**
β_Φ = (1/|V|) Σ_{i∈V} q^T tanh(W · h_i^Φ + b)

Where h_i^Φ is node i's representation for meta-path Φ.

e_i^{(l+1)} = Σ_{u∈N_i} (1/√|N_u||N_i|) e_u^{(l)}

**Layer Combination**
e_u = Σ_{l=0}^L α_l e_u^{(l)}

Where α_l are combination weights (often uniform: α_l = 1/(L+1)).
