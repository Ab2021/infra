## 1. Introduction to Model Monitoring

### 1.1 Why Model Monitoring Matters

**The Reality of Production Models**

**Models Degrade Over Time**
Unlike traditional software, machine learning models experience performance degradation in production:
- **Changing User Behavior**: User preferences and behavior patterns evolve continuously
- **Market Dynamics**: Business environments change, affecting relevance of historical training data
- **Seasonal Variations**: Periodic changes in user behavior (holidays, events, trends)
- **External Factors**: Economic conditions, social trends, technological changes

**Business Impact of Model Degradation**
- **Revenue Loss**: Poor recommendations directly impact conversion rates and revenue
- **User Experience**: Degraded search results lead to user frustration and churn
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Competitors with better-maintained models gain market share
- **Operational Costs**: Manual intervention and emergency fixes are expensive

**Key Business Questions:**
- How do we know when a model's effectiveness degrades?
- What's the cost of delayed detection of model performance issues?
- How do we balance model stability with adaptation to changing patterns?

### 1.2 Types of Changes in Production Systems

**Data Distribution Changes**

**Input Feature Drift**
Changes in the distribution of input features:
- **User Demographics**: Shifts in user base demographics over time
- **Content Characteristics**: Changes in available content or product catalog
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Evolution of user interaction patterns
- **Technical Environment**: Changes in devices, browsers, or app versions

**Target Variable Drift**
Changes in the distribution of target variables:
- **Click-Through Rates**: Overall CTR changes due to UI modifications or user adaptation
- **Conversion Rates**: Changes in purchase behavior due to economic factors
- **Rating Distributions**: Shifts in how users provide ratings over time
- **Engagement Patterns**: Changes in how users engage with content

**Relationship Changes (Concept Drift)**

**Feature-Target Relationships**
The relationship between features and targets changes:
- **Preference Evolution**: User preferences for certain features change over time
- **Context Sensitivity**: Same features may have different predictive power in different contexts
- **Interaction Effects**: How features interact with each other may change
- **Causal Relationships**: Underlying causal relationships may shift

### 1.3 Monitoring Framework Components

## 2. Types of Drift

### 2.1 Data Drift (Covariate Shift)

**Definition and Characteristics**

**Mathematical Formulation**
Data drift occurs when P(X) changes while P(Y|X) remains constant:
- **Training Distribution**: P_train(X)
- **Production Distribution**: P_prod(X)
- **Drift Condition**: P_train(X) ≠ P_prod(X) but P_train(Y|X) = P_prod(Y|X)

**Common Causes**
- **Population Changes**: Changes in user demographics or behavior
- **Sampling Bias**: Changes in how data is collected or filtered
- **External Events**: Major events affecting user behavior patterns
- **Technical Changes**: System updates affecting feature collection

**Detection Methods**

**Statistical Tests**
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Compare distributions for continuous features
- **Chi-Square Test**: Compare distributions for categorical features
- **Population Stability Index (PSI)**: Measure stability of feature distributions
- **Wasserstein Distance**: Measure distance between probability distributions

**Implementation Example for PSI:**
```
PSI = Σ (P_prod_i - P_train_i) × ln(P_prod_i / P_train_i)

Interpretation:
- PSI < 0.1: No significant change
- 0.1 ≤ PSI < 0.25: Some change, monitoring recommended
- PSI ≥ 0.25: Significant change, action required
```

**Machine Learning-Based Detection**
- **Adversarial Validation**: Train classifier to distinguish training vs. production data
- **Autoencoder Reconstruction Error**: Higher reconstruction error indicates distribution shift
- **Density Estimation**: Compare density estimates between training and production data

### 2.2 Concept Drift

**Definition and Types**

**Mathematical Formulation**
Concept drift occurs when P(Y|X) changes while P(X) may or may not change:
- **Pure Concept Drift**: P(Y|X) changes, P(X) remains constant
- **Real Concept Drift**: Both P(Y|X) and P(X) change

**Types of Concept Drift**
- **Sudden Drift**: Abrupt change in concept
- **Gradual Drift**: Slow, continuous change over time
- **Incremental Drift**: Step-wise changes in concept
- **Recurring Drift**: Periodic changes that repeat over time
